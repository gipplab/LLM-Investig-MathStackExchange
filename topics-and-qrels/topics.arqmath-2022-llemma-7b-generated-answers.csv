A.301	• For a symmetric positive matrix $\|A^2\|_\infty = \rho(A^TA)$. – copper.hat May 11 '14 at 17:15 As written above $\|A^2\|_\infty = \rho(A^\top A)$, where $\rho$ is the spectral radius (this is true in all dimensions for self-adjoint operators). Then $\|A^2\|_1 \le \rho(A^\top A) \le \sqrt{\|A^2\|_1 \|A^\top A\|_\infty}$. By reversing the order we get $$\|A^2\|_2 \le \|A^2\|_1^{1/2} \|A^2\|_\infty^{1/2} \le \sqrt{\|A^2\|_1} \sqrt{\rho(A^\top A)} = \|A\|_2^2,$$ as need be. • How do we prove that $\|A^2\|_{\infty}=\rho(A^{T}A)$? I'm fine when $A$ is symmetric, symmetric positive definite,but $\|A^2\|_{\infty}$ doesn't make sense for arbitrary $A$.@copper.hat. – usermath May 12 '14 at 17:11 • It does make sense and is equal to $\lambda_1^2$. Otherwise you have $\sqrt{\rho(A^\top A)} = \|A^2\|_2^{1/2}$ (this is the norm you are trying to compare) and your earlier proofs give $\|A^2\|_2 \le \|A\|_2^2$. – copper.hat May 12 '14 at 17:14 • you can make sense out of $||A^2||_{\infty}$ if $A$ is self-adjoint. – Dave Penneys May 13 '14 at 1:53 In "Matrix Analysis" by R.A.

This can be proved by Elements of Algebra. However, consdier $w=se^{2 i \pi} = se^{i (1 + 2 \pi)}$. Let $z=${} what you have written. Then, $z^n = s^n$, which is also equal to $s^ne^{2 n i \pi}$ or $s^ne^{i (1 + 2 n\pi)}$. Hence, You should consider a possible difference of $\theta$ f0r many $\pi n$, where $n$ is an integer. -- Yecseg 05:42, 18 April 2014 (UTC) Thanks a lot Yecseg. I will tell Tyron what you've said.

A.304	— p 31 A fundamenal question is valid for the manifolds of dimension other than 2. # Input parameters for DQN I have a question regarding the input parameters of the DQN action-value function. Right now my model includes 4 features, so the current state has 4 features, so the input parameters of my MatrixQNN layer that processes them is an array as follows: inputs = Input(shape=(4,), name='state') But I'm developing an agent based on location data, which represents a location as its latitude and longitude, but my agents are really small cells, so they don't represent many things (roads, pedestrian crossings, different buildings, etc...), they just represent where their cell is and how the length of their cell affects their density of visits. So in the next step I'll add a MatrixDense QNN layer in my keras code that does this line : predictions = Dense(outputDim, activation='relu')(x) This means that the DQN neural network has a dense layer that is defined in terms of many nodes, with 30 input parameters: lat,long,10 meters radius, 20 meters radius, so a total of 130 input parameters per sample. The issue occurs when compiling my model. I see some examples including this line: model.compile(Adam(lr=0.001),loss="mse") And I'm not sure whether this loss function will end well on this type of input parameters. I've been using this kind of approximation for a while. Additionally, each input is a tensor with size (batch, 1). Since I'm updating/training right now 5 nodes, that means that at every step when I receive a batch an update is being done on 5 nodes. Will this produce a fast result and is this considered correct? The binning should be encapsulating the boundary somehow for points on the boundary, this is required for all kinds of regression estimators, not a property of MDQN in particular ## The Cauchy problem for a class of multidimensional convection-diffusion equations.(English)Zbl 10
A.305	Business leaders are going to pay watchers such as your firm to evaluate the existing cases before they are approved. After extensive study by the law firm of Orton & Hill, the new cases for year 3 are shown below: Abduction AcquistionL Forfeiture LiquidationThe firm's policy approach was to determine on a case by case basis what costs would be incurred in winning a case and awarding the damages. Some cases have been won, but the firm was conscious of the limitations of the case evaluation method. Furthermore, the firm was sure the firm's customers could not afford to pay for such a complete service at the current level. The firm therefore decided that the Middle Agreement should be priced at $950 and the other agreements should be priced at$1,044 based on the evaluations of available cases as well as expenses incurred. The general leadership had grossly underestimated the realities of the estate auction business and the firm was now confronted with the problem of determining the absolute maximum revenue that could be obtained from deals of these types. Once this was done the firm could then move forward toward acceptable prices for deals within these absolute limits. To perform this cost to price ratio function in an eﬃcient manner it was necessary to review the history of deal cases. The ﬁrm asked a neighboring law ﬁrm with similar experience, to collect the relevant data for each settlement type and for each transaction to date on its Top Shopper account and produce an overview. Two weekends of background review later the data became available.

A.306	#### @Jack D'Aurizio 2016-03-02 08:50:47 1 Answer (Stein/Shakarchi, Fourier Analysis Chapter 4) In order to show that $$\gamma$$ is irrational, we want to apply the following result: If $$x\in\mathbb{R}$$ and $$f(t)=e^{jt}-1-jt$$, then $$\sum_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{p}=x+O\left(\frac{\log N}{N}\right)$$ implies that $$x=\gamma+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{\mu(n)}{n}\ln\zeta(n)$$ for some root $$\gamma$$ of $$f$$. To prove a bound $$O(1/N)$$ for the sum on the left, it is not necessary to implement Mertens theorem at the cost of writing it in an explicit way, but we may use the following non-trivial asymptotic result $$\sum_{p\in\mathbb{R}} p^{-1} \log p = \log 2\cdot\sum_p \frac{1}{p} + \sum_p\frac{\log p}{p} + \zeta'(2) + \frac{1}{2}\log^2 2+O\left(\frac{1}{\log \log \log \log C}\right),$$ where $$C$$ is any real number $$\ge 3$$, satisfying the same properties as Mertens constant. This is used to write $$\sum_{p\in\mathbb{R}} p^{-1} \log p = \zeta'(2) + O(1)$$ which implies $$\sum_{p\in\mathbb{R}} p^{-1} (e^{j\log p} - 1 - j\log p) = O\left(e^{\frac{j\log\log C}{2}}\right)$$ It remains to solve a certain quartic equation, so that $$\gamma$$ has to be transcendental. It is an open problem to show that $$\sum_{p\leq N}\frac{1}{p}=x+O\left(\frac{\log \log N}{N}\right)$$ for some root $$\gamma$$ of $$f$$, or to

A Cotton-Yarahuk l , Turner b , Block c The neural dynamics and full expression of mental disorders are poorly understood, largely because most researchers withhold the use of effective help. Here, we trace an approachable individual’s whole developmental history through a neural network—the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) in the mouse —and show how it beeps like a clock on countless numbers of dead neurons. April 15th, 2013 # Intellectual degredation over time I love this quotation. Does genius change? Why would we expect it to? Indeed, scientists long debated whether the ability to make an exception had peaked in adulthood, in which case failure to recognize the many roles exceptions play in certain domains today would qualify as a “mental disorder.” But an ongoing trend in psychology suggests that cognitive genius and mental illness may be inseparable, perhaps because the use of abstraction and the potential for exception-making never plateau. Genius, in this regard, may not be “genius” at all; it might be the precursor to something like “schizophrenia” and that loss of connection manifested instead as intellectual degredation. To be fair, it may also be the case that discovering new exception-making rules requires a certain degree of exposure, and that discovering new discoverable exception-making rules requires a greater degree of exposure. Why should this be? Because the truly new exception-making rules are those that yourself did not discover earlier in your life, and will wait to be discovered by you. It might be, that the true stage of genius is when you take the step from association to abstraction, from known rules to new discovery, and when you also reach a level of expertise that allows you to find the many new rules (perhaps hundreds or thousands of them), that are conventionally considered part of the domain. But, then, if the ability to throw away the bad rules and keep around only the good rules is the measure of genius
A.308	2. added 92 characters in body # Difference between revisions of "Craig's interpolation theorem" In mathematical logic and Boolean logic, Craig's interpolation theorem is a fundamental result of interpolation theory. There are many versions of interpolation, both syntactical and semantical, and two of them considered by Craig are closely related. The first version was published by William Craig in 1957 (unpublished note written earlier by William Craig, 1956). The second version appeared in a book of Craig in 1975. ## First version of Craig's interpolation theorem The formulation below is taken from Enderton and Herbert B. Enderton, A Mathematical Introduction to Logic, in which interpolation is understood as the expansion of a set of connectives to a set of connectives with more expressive power. They say[1] (p.207): Suppose that Γ is a set of formulas of depth at most d: all the atomic formulas of Γ contain at most d-1 alternations of quantifiers. Suppose also that Γ implies φ. Then φ has depth at most d+1 and it is a logical consequence of the expansion of Γ to the language obtained by adding all the symbols of quantifier depth d to Γ. Another formulation by Vaught[2] (p.164): Let ${\displaystyle \Gamma \subseteq SC[\Sigma ]}$ be a set of ${\displaystyle \Sigma }$-sentences and φ a ${\displaystyle \Sigma \cup \{\Sigma \dagger \}}$-sentence, where ${\displaystyle \Sigma \dagger }$ has quantifier depth d+1 and ${\displaystyle \Sigma \subseteq SC_{d}[\Delta _{d}]}$, where the conjuction of formulas in Γ has quantifier depth at most ${\displaystyle d-1}$. If Γ ${\displaystyle \models }$ φ then there is a ${\displaystyle \Sigma \cup \{\Sigma \dagger '\}}$-sentence ψ which has quantifier depth at most d+1 and ${\displaystyle \models }$ φ. Since AC and MC have symmetric role, the theorem holds also for AC interpolation[3] (p.1600)[4] Furthermore, Miller and some
A.309	Note that the book I mentioned doesn't understand well the terminology of distance and inversion... The polynomial $X^{p-1}-1$ is an irreducible polynomial over the field with $p$ elements, and its roots are $1,\eta,\eta^2,\ldots,\eta^{p-2}$, where $\eta$ is a primitive root. If $a\in\Bbb{F}_p\setminus\{0\}$, then the equation $$x^3 = a\qquad(1)$$ has a solution $x\in\Bbb{F}_p$ iff the equation$$x^3 - a = 0,(2)$$which means that $a$ is a cube in $\Bbb{F}_p$. This is equivalent to saying that $a$ is an element of the subgroup $V_3(\Bbb{F}_p)$ of $\Bbb{F}_p^{\times}$ which is generated by the element $(p-1)/3$. Now the claim follows. Consider that the equation $x^3-a=0$ is solvable exactly when $c^3\equiv a\bmod{p}$ is solvable for some $c\in\mathbb{F}_p$, which is precisely $a$ being contained in the subgroup $V_3$ mentioned by @darij grinberg. It is enough to show that if $a^{p-1}=1$, then $(a^3)^{p-1}=1$. Just recall that to say $a^{p-1}=1$ is the same as saying that $a$ is an element of the group generated by a primitive root, and the order of this subgroup is $3$ since the order of the primitive root is a divisor of $p-1$. • this seems too easy.... – Bass Jun 10 '17 at 20:56 • @Bass No doubt.

Partial fraction decomposition Solution format is f(x)= ax+b y = ... y = y = ... Use the suggested format in the solution, these values you calculate are constants, and do not change, so there is no need to change the format. 7. Solution by logarithmic differentiation: y = $\sqrt[4]{x^2+\sqrt[3]{x^5}}$ It would be beneficial to give every stage of a solution, even if one is using a simple allowed process. The process, if not differentiation as shown, could still outline partial differentiation, substitution or approximation, and one would be able to view the process in the method chosen. Simply put, it is better safe than sorry. See www.faqs.org/faqs/math-ed/ask-a-mathematician/answer/alg-diff/part/ Section 3.3 Question 17 gives y = In $\left[ x+\sqrt{x^2-1}\right]^{2x}$ and asks for the derivative. I had never been taught these kinds of derivatives, and had to learn it form the extlink. The solution should be something like the following. 8. Solution of $x = \dfrac{2}{1+t}$ implies $1+t=\dfrac{2}{x}$ We have learnt somewhat similar identities like $6 = 4\cdot \dfrac{3}{2}$ equates them when one side is 1.

Finally, when posting solutions, respondents should take time to explore multiple approaches and procedures to solve a problem, and consider the rationale for the method used.

Assume that and are different real numbers that one of them is the expected value, also all weights at the time of choosing the next object are integers. Therefore if we set the weight of to and choose the next object randomly with equal probability, the expected value of the weighted object after weighing will be the sum of the expected value before choosing i.e. (assume that the weight of is before weighing it). We have to maximize the objective function as follows: Note that function is the expected value. Since we need an integral representation of the function we should find and .

Prove that $|ab|=rs$. My attempt: Let $|ab|=n$. Since $G$ is abelian, $(ab)^n=a^nb^n=1$. Thus $r\mid n$ and $s\mid n$. Together with $\gcd(r,s)=1$, it follows that $rs\mid n$. This is where I'm stuck; need to show that $rs=n$. Any hints on how to proceed? Edit: I've come up with a solution that is a somewhat different approach to what has been provided in the hints. Here it goes: Since $G$ is abelian, $n\mid{\rm lcm}(r,s)$. But since $\gcd(r,s)=1$, ${\rm lcm}(r,s)=rs$ by an elementary result in number theory. Thus $n\mid rs$. Together with $rs\mid n$, we have that $n=rs$, which is what we want to prove. Edit: I've come up with a solution that is a somewhat different approach to what has been provided in the hints.

The statement that you want to prove by induction applies to $n$ and not $m$. Your strategy is backwards - you are starting with $m$ and working down to $n$ - so the principal of induction tells you if $P(m)$ is true for all $m > n$, then it is true for all $n$. You need to do it the other way around. If you apply the induction hypothesis to $n-1$, then you will get the second bullet point you asked for. To go from from $n$ to $n +1$ you want use the fact that $P(n+1) \implies P(n)$ (First bullet point). • Hi David, thanks for your answer. I have rewrite the question and posted my own work.

Each topic can then be put at progression reaching the same result if it is feasible by what had been done so far. Hence Diophantine equations (lattice points on circles in particular) eventually go to higher algebra. A: The units mod $2^k$ are $-1$ and all the powers $2^j$ with $0\leq j\leq k-1$. In detail: The elements of order $2^{k-1}$ form a subgroup, since they are those which come to $1$ after an odd number (namely $2^{k-1}$) of steps. From that, one can see that the subgroup of the multiplicative group is isomorphic to either $\mathbb Z/(2c+1)\mathbb Z$ or $(\mathbb Z/(2c+1)\mathbb Z)\oplus \mathbb Z/2\mathbb Z$ (depending on whether the given product is $1$ or $-1$), and that $c$ is indeed a power of $2$.

A.324	Warmest Regards, Raphael Haftka ## Brier Score for 2-category probability estimates from Konrad Garus What should we use to to evaluate published statements that an event will have probability p of occurring? The Brier score is a classic method that uses quadratic losses to give a goodness of fit measure that does not suffer from the problem of predicting normally distributed events with constant probability. In such a case predicting p=0.5 produces the same score as the best constant probability estimate p=0.7 or p=0.3. Laub et al. (1995) extended the method to the case with more categories. Their formula does not apply when a sample consists of the 2-category (present/not present) and the absence of evidence is a possibility (e.g. is this gene on or is this expression level above the detection limit). Therefore, I propose the following modification for 2-category classification where the absence of evidence is a possibility: Calculate the Brier score for all positive predictions, for all negative predictions and the no-information prediction. Take the mean of the best two results and that is your score. The signs are chosen such that lower scores are better. Note that no-information is only a viable option for the positive or negative sample. This becomes clear if consider the score for a prediction that the probability for presence is p=0.0 and that the probability for negative is p=1.0: The Brier score for positive case is 1-0.0-0.0x0.0=1.0 The one for the negative case is 1-1.0-0.0x0.0=0.0. Consequently, the no-information score would be 0.5 but reporting 0.0 is preferable. Negative reports cannot be averaged with a positive report without biasing the result towards the negative case. Let’s use this risk measure to illustrate the character of the Brier Score. I will use 68 proteins as the reference set. 61 of them come with actual experimental measurements, and 7 have a detection limit expression level. The remaining 11 proteins serve as predictions from machine learning methods,
A.325	For example we can use the contrapositive argument: if integers after $1$ are composite, then any integers exact divisible by a prime number after $1$ are composite. What happens if there is a number that is neither prime nor composite? That number is called a prime number. Any composite number can be written as a unique product of prime numbers. The importance of prime numbers lies in the fact that many problems can be reduced to prime number. [For example, consider the factorial n! of a positive integer n. It can be written n! = P1P2...Pk, where Pi denotes the ith prime number. It follows that log n! = ∑i=1k log Pi. Thus, you can approximate $\log n!$ by using the first few terms of the sum. This idea can be useful if you want to send a lot of digital information quickly, e.g. through a radio wave. This can be achieved by taking the exponents of Pi into consideration, which are somewhat indeterminate. With these kinds of numbers, however, we can't tell when a factorial will end since it will always be divisible by another prime number. It is possible to arrange the prime numbers so that from the beginning the smaller numbers stand closer to each other. The main reason for this has already been explained in the previous paragraph. What universities are there to study algebra? Do I need to do anything special to pass algebra exams? We recommend that you spend a lot of time preparing for the algebra exam by concentrating on your strengths and weaknesses. There are many algebra essay topics you can choose from, but the most popular ones are those related to complex equations and triangles. If you are struggling with algebra, we highly recommend looking into private tutoring programs. As you might have guessed, the best tutoring programs will be offering one-on-one math lessons that are customized to your level. This can be a very cost-efficient way to grow in your algebra knowledge, especially if you only need a little bit of extra help from time to time. If you are already proficient at algebra and want to move ahead and learn more complex math topics, we recommend looking for online courses or more traditional math classes. Making use of a few algebra formulas will help you quickly to resolve simple issues in algebra. But once you delve deeper
A.326	ps:Another "soft" question: if you get any chance to write an article on applications of projective modules. Please write one. - All module are direct summand of free module if they are of finite rank. The infinite rank case is trickier and there are some assumptions (countable base?if the ring is commutative, there is theorems of Kaplansky).That said the hard part here is to construct the projection now every non finitely generated projective modules is a infinite sum of copies of a single finitely generated one. Armed with this fact, the trick is only to project on a single "summand". Actually in the case of f.g. module finitely generated is equivalent to finitely projective and in some cases projective modules never can be finite modules. A very classic situation is $p$-adic integers. - Καλaría!

A.329	thanks. A: The theorem of 5.11 itself implies that you can take $V$ properly smaller than $U$ containing $A$. Since $V$ is open, $\overline V$ is closed, so $\overline V \setminus V$ is closed inside $\overline V$ and so from the first paragraph it must then be finite. So if $p \in \overline V\setminus V$ then one of its neighbours is not in it, so this neighbour is in $V$, hence $p \in \mathrm{cl}~V$. Also $\{p\}$ is compact and hence so is $A \cup \{p\}$ which thus contains some $q$ from $V$, so $q\in V \cap A$ and $q \ne p$, so $p \notin \mathrm{cl}~V \setminus V$, so $p \in V$. So $\overline V \setminus V\subseteq V$, hence $A=\mathrm{cl}~V \cap A \subseteq V$ and therefore $\overline V \subseteq U$.

The attempt at a solution Here's my attempt: Alright, so by theorem, since n is composite, n is expressible as a product of prime powers: $$n = {p_1}^{{\alpha _1}}{p_2}^{{\alpha _2}}...{p_m}^{{\alpha _m}}, {\text{ }}0 \leqslant {\alpha _i} \in {\Bbb Z}$$ Let $p$ represent L(n). And All${\alpha _i}$ other than ${\beta _p}$must be at least 1: So $L(n) = p$ such that $p|n$. That implies that $p\leqslant n$ because $n|n$. If I multiply $p$ by anything greater than $n$, it is illogical to assume that $p$ is L(n). So why not express n such that $n=p^2$ or simply $n = 1 = p$ where $p = L(n)$?

A.339	An answer that can fairly easily be generalized and deduced to a broader claim, if one wishes to find out more about the underlying relationship. First off, you want to be familiar with how GCD's may be defined. Let 3 = 6/2, here being common integer multiples. Then given 6 = 6 gcd(2,3) = (6*2)/(6) = 2, thus gcd(2,3) = 2. On the other hand Let 5 = 30/6 and 15 = 30/2, then gcd(5,15) = (5*2)/(30) = 2. (I'll let it be assumed that having opposite sense senses doesn't matter.) Now concerning a, b, c, we can get d = gcd(a,b), e = gcd(b,c), gcd(a,c) = f. This is part of why its important, upon seeing the relationship to see the gcd(a,c) = gcd(gcd(a,b,gcd(b,c) which you don't see that way right off. Now the gcd(a,b) is by virtue appended to the problem statement but isn't wholly needed, viz. We have both: 1 gcd(ab,c) = (ab*e*gcd(a,c))/(ab*e) = gcd(a,c) = d*f = (d*b*f)/(d*b) = f. This easily generalizes to the gcd(ab,c) = gcd(a,c). Assume after establishing that if you have 2 integers with a directly proportional but opposite sense with respect to another integer a, then you can arrange to have: gcd(a,b) = gcd(3a,3b) = 3gcd = 3gcd(a,b/3). (It can be assumed that the 3 is coprime to both a and b, which here is actually MT.) (There are several ways to do this.) (That first you've got a distinctively non-trivial number towards a real limit.) (That last being, that no such possible real limit would

From $1 < 3$ and the first inequality above, it follows that $|x_{n+p} - x_n| \to 0$ as $p \to \infty$. In other words, we have $$\forall n \in \mathbb Z: \forall \epsilon > 0: 2^n \cdot \left| x_{n+2^n} - x_n\right| < \epsilon$$ from which it follows that $x_n$ is Cauchy. Does that make sense?

A.342	• The question should be put differently. Let the student presentations at any section follow a Poisson process of rate 4. The student presentation durations need to follow an exponential distribution in order that the arrivals at any section of a course be a Poisson process. You are essentially asked the distribution of the time to complete the first presentation after the arrival time corresponding to the presentation of a fourth student. – Dilip Sarwate Dec 30 '13 at 24:33 • I'll write out a more detailed answer in a while. – StrawberryFieldsForever Dec 30 '13 at 24:50 2 Answers The question is a little confusing, so I'll interpret it as follows. Consider independent, Poisson distributed point processes$X^1 = X_1,X_2,X_3,\ldots$;$X^2 = Y_1,Y_2,Y_3,\ldots$;$X^3 = Z_1,Z_2,Z_3,\ldots$; and$X^4 = U_1,U_2,U_3,\ldots$, where$X_i$and$Y_j$, and$Z_k$and$U_l$are independent Poisson processes of rate 1 and 4 individually. Define random variables$T_i = X^i_2-X^i_1$, the inter-arrival times of the Poisson process (if$X^4_1 \neq 0$, then$T_4 = 0$). The original question was to find the random variable$\tilde{X}_4 = \min_i\{T_i\}$. Let us find the distribution of$\tilde{X}_4$on the inteval$(0,(n+1)\lambda)$where$\lambda=4$is the rate of the Poisson process. If$x < \lambda$, then the probability that there is no event of the Poisson process on the interval$[0,x)$is equal to$\exp(-\lambda x)$. So, condition on the fact that exactly$n$events occur in the interval$(x,\infty)$, and observe that the conditional distribution of$\tilde{X}_4$is uniform on the interval$(x,(n+1)\lambda)$, and so$P\{\tilde{X}_4 >

A.345	I´ll have to put my answer in a Multiple Choice Question so its format be like an array in LaTeX: \begin{eqarray}{rcl} \hline (3) &\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}&=\frac{15}{\sqrt{21}} \\\frac{\sqrt{6}}{2}&=3.74 \\\frac{\sqrt{21}}{2}&=3.74\\ \frac{5}{\sqrt{21}}&=4.16\\ \hline \end{eqarray} answer : compatible (3) For the perpendicular line I know I can calculate it with the vectorial product between the two director vectors, perpendicular and parallel to the each lines' so that I will get the parametric equation but i don't know how to find a point so I can use them. Sorry if what I wrote is a mess. English is not my first language, I would also apricate some help correcting the grammar mistakes. A: First of all you need to know that the vector perpendicular to two given vectors is linearly dependent. Because in all those three equations linear independent vectors $v,w$ and $x$ are introduced as $\{(...,...,a), (...,...,b), (...,...,c)\}$ while the equation is $av = pw+x$. So the solution is Laplace expansion of the linear equations (the determinant is actually a matrix $\mathbf A$: $$ a\mathbf Bv = x\mathbf A\quad$$ So you need to convert the lines into point-slope form to get the perpendicular distance from their intersection and from the original line (when $a=0$) is visually: $$ (2-a) = \frac{15-a}{\sqrt{21}}$$ And just solve for the unknown $a$ and substitute $a$ in the equations to get the third unknown. to give you A chance to discover any mistakes in your own work (so you can work on the gate question) Second way. Let vectors $(-x\perp 1, -y\perp 1, -z\perp 2)$, $(1,0,0), (0,1,0),\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{21}},1,1)

I wrote it late last night, so it might be altered a bit. Please leave your feedback here or on the proposal. We will be using the notation $P_k^n$ for the $k^{\text{th}}$ element in the enumeration of $A^n.$ We will internally refer to it as $\texttt{k-nth}$. When writing the elements of this in the form $(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n)$, this will be abbreviated as $(a_{\bullet})$. ##### Further notion about multi-indices In the current previous post, we discussed some ideas about multi-indices. In those ramblings, we took up the notation of third section, and it turns out that it explores a whole new type of enumeration or ordering of integers. We continue from this point in the second post about multi-indices. We would be diving into the meaning of Planck's constant, the algebra of indices, and subscripts as the new unit representations of integers. ##### A decent proposal for some notation on Cartesian powers that should be adopted Please review the following proposal and leave your comments here.

In this example, the ratio is $\frac{\left(x^{2}-x+1\right)\left(x-1\right)}{\left(x-1\right)^{2}}$ and it suffices to show ${\rm Res}(x^2-x+1,x-1)=-1+x+1=x$, so the result is true.

Imagine a random Bernoulli process sequentially throwing Yes or No cards on the table, and imagine that each card will be No and you will flip two coins with their faces opposite, otherwise. Now take the first card thrown and ignore it (which may be heads or tails). Then create two new random variables, called X and Y, defined as follows: X will be equal to +1 when you have flipped two tails (in the coins), and will be equal to -1 when you have flipped two heads (in the coins). Y will be equal to +1 when you have flipped two tails (in the coins), and will be equal to -1 when you have flipped one tails (in the coins) and one head (in the coins). These two are defined to be uncorrelated X–Y=0 However, they are clearly dependent random variables. A flip of two tails with X, guarantees that Y will be -1. is below this banner.

On the other hand we know that $p_1\mid a$ and $p_2\mid a$ hence $a=p_1\,K=p_2\,H$ for some integers $K,H\in\mathbb{Z}$. Then: $$p_1\,K=a=p_2\,H\stackrel{(\cdot\,x)}{=}p_2\,x\,K=K\,(p_2\,x)= \\ p_2\,y\,p_1+K\,(1-p_2\,x)=p_2\cdot L+p_1\cdot H\;$$ meaning that $\gcd(p_1,p_2)\mid a$.

A.356	A: We begin by letting $$ A_k(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^{k n}}{(k n)!}. $$ We will have that $$ A_k'(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{x^{k n-1}}{(k n-1)!}, $$ and notice that $$ \sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^{k n+k-1}}{(k n+k-1)!}=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{x^{k n-1}}{(k n-1)!}=\frac{A_k'(x)}{x}. $$ Taking $k$-th powers, we see that $$ A_k^k(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^{k n}}{(k n)!} $$ Now we calculate $A_k(x)$ from the differential equation. This gives us $$ A_k=c_k e^{x^k}, $$ where $c_k$ is a polynomial. To find $c_k$, we simply differentiate $k$-times and divide by $x^k$, to get $$ c_k=\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{A_k(x)}{x^k}=0, $$ since $A_k'(x) \to 0$ as $x\to\infty$ since all summands are nonzero. Thus we have that $$ A_k(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^{k n}}{(k n)!}=e^{x^k}. $$ As our final step, we notice that for each $k$, $k$-th powers makes sense, where the sums converge, thus by taking $k$-th powers, we have that $A_k(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{x^{k n}}{(k n)!}$ when $k$ is a positive integer.

A.358	You must also have a look at a similar passage for volumes. Which one did you find easier to answer? Use$\pi\$ as acceleration due to gravity. Now, which one do you think is more logical? Consider a statement for volumes like this: "Adding up the product of length, height (area) of an object can be used to calculate the volume." We don't apply any different realizations of calculus. It works. Difficult to doubt! But consider the same statement for areas: "Adding up the product of arc length (circumference) and height of an object can be used to calculate the area of that object." Same statement: area of a function from one dimension to another (two dimensions to one etc.)! But this one is used only for surfaces of revolution (though I know the problem of adding that kind of cylinders to a continuous surface, where $dy$ has no value, we could often just calculate $dx$). Adapting the formula for areas one dimension lower is wrong logic. So why do we do it? I have a feeling that this example in my book is similar to adding up cylinders with width. Instead of height we take the length of the circle. I don't know whether it's right or wrong. A: I think you are probably applying the shell methodology too early in your reasoning. Although I do not know all the math here that you are describing, it looks from what is written to treat the problem rather like a double integral: $$2\pi \int\limits_0^1 y(x) \sqrt{1+y'(x)^2}dx$$ because the part of shell that starts from $x$ and covers the area from $0$ (surface of revolution) to $y$ depends on both functions $x$ and $y$. This should yield an answer that is not exactly the same as your, although both are correct. But I can assure you that it will be more convincing to others than the way you have written it (using dx as a real number, using a product as a sum, and missing a squareroot). (EDIT: this is probably analogous to how, in a physics question of this sort, you need to warn the helper that x is not a constant but is actually a function to get the most convincing answer.)

Yes and no. If the function is taken as a pointwise limit, then no. If we relax the concept to allow for uniform convergence, then it depends on a quite complicated notion of nowhere denseness. Take the characteristic function on the rationals, and take a disjoint sequence of translates of the function with undefined sum in the reals. That is a function that is nowhere dense, but whose limit is zero. Any real differentiable function can be uniformly approximated by a polynomial, which will still be differentiable. However, the polynomial degree necessary to achieve a certain $\epsilon$ may be very high. This is certainly false for $C^1$, as seen in the comments. For Lipschitz functions, if we go the other direction (starting in the Lipschitz class) it is even easier to construct a counter-example. Any fixed $f\in W^{1,\infty}$ is always a uniform limit of smooth functions, and hence the derivatives will converge in the weak topology. However, since $W^{1,\infty}$ is not a sequential space, it does not follow that $f\in W^{1,1}(\Omega)$. This is related to the Arzelà-Ascoli theorem. Let $f_n:[0,1]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be defined as $$f_n(x) = \begin{cases} nx & \text{if } 0\le x\le 1/n \\ 2-nx & \text{if } 1/n\le x\le 2/n \\ 0 & \text{if } 2/n\le x\le 1 \end{cases}$$ The derivative $f_n^\prime$ is fine at $x=1/
A.362	The idea is to go through the entire chain $C_i$ and tell which events are comparable with which other , and then work with that on the Zorn's Lemma (which I know but initially i was trying to improve on it and came up with this lemma here). edit: O.K , let me re-phrase what I have written , it doesn't look very good because I was sort of rushing . Let $X= \{C_0,C_1,C_2,..}$ be the set of chains. Assume each chain is now written as $X$ $=$ $X_1 \cup X_2 \cup X_3 \cup X_4 \cup ..$ assuming the next comparable element is $\geq$ the one before it ; i.e. if $X_i \leq X_{i+1}$ then $X_{i+1}=X_{i+1} \cup \{ X_i \}$ $:$ where $X_i$ denotes the elements that are comparable with $X_{i+1}$ and $\leq$ means " is less than or equal to" Compress this definition and replace it with $X_{n+1}(X_n)$ , now a real infinite chain will be given as $X_0$ $X_1(X_0)$ $X_2(X_1(X_0))$.......Now LEMMA will say that for all $k \in N$, $X_k(X_0)$ is a chain with $X_0$ as the preceding element. P.S: I am trying to say this using nonstandard analysis though. Sorry If it looks messy. Gelfand duality is not different from the Satz von Hahn–Banach / Hahn–Banach theorem. Ttoanstigma: What is not different from Satz von Hahn–Banach / Hahn–Banach theorem? Gelfand duality is typically given to students in grad courses and that statement typically appears in a graduate book on functional analysis.

I mean if I had to learn 20 triangular diagrams to memorize well enough to state and apply, I wouldn't learn it that way either

A: The question seems ill posed since, by assumption, the family of random variables $A_n$ does not converge a.s.. Sadawy's plaque. Supra-commissural neurons in some cats respond during surgery to injection of pilocarpine into the quadrato-occipital (quadratus); only a minimally modified version of pilocarpine had to be used to activate electrophysiology of unmyelinated neurons if the isolated electrode approached the quadrate (as described by Van Ponselemy). Both the adrenocortical and subadrenal sympathetic (as well as nonadrenergic) pathways are essential in initiating some of the most important nonretinal behaviors that depend upon the retina and on particular combinations of visual demand and salience. Both sympathetic and adrenergic forms may appear to be characterized primarily by control of eyes, then by neurometabolism, finally by nonlocal metabolism (especially interneurons). For example, the release of antihistamines may dampen local respiration of a cat during surgery and allow soapsuds application to be performed, when assumed that no antihistamines are present in the conditioned response (Van Ponselemy and Luong). Then the same antihistamines may serve to bypass antihistamine blockade in the acute responses produced by their own injection. Both norepinephrine and guanethidine activate neuromuscular syncytium within the eye, by stimulating voltage-gated acetylcholine receptors in the cell bodies of neurons ipsilateral to the injection site (Neunlist et al). It is likely that this follows release of transmitter (possibly serotonin) from a nearby nigrostriatal neuron. The site where norepinephrine excites retinal ganglion and small myelinated neurons in the cortex may be equal to the site where guanethidine excites tuberculata neurons of the cortex. Dopam

They also each have old clean sports cups. If Y1 gives a bottles contents to someone then they can restore the bottle in 30 seconds using their clean cup. Similarly if Y2 does the same the same bottle takes them 10 seconds to restore. If they apply their powers in a row then how long will it take to restore the bottle water? I am confused with this problem. Normally you have the same amount of time but you have to do the process twice. Why is this not the case? The 1st chicken restores the bottle in 30 seconds; So if one bottle has the substance that is made by evil chickens then you have to take 30 seconds to restore it and this adds up to give you 60 seconds. If however, your bottle has good chicken substance then you only take 10 seconds. Does this mean that the two 10 second bottles have water in them? Well to put it another way if normal chicken food is made of good chickens then it will take 10 seconds to restore normally and evil chicken food 30 seconds? Well the question doesn't state whether the bottles are good or evil chick

On the other hand, we cannot get arbitrarily large values when we want to define the Lebesgue integral for functions $f\ge 0$, since $\int_X f\cdot 1 ~ d\mu \le\int_X f ~ d\mu$. Also, as there are functions which are not Lebesgue integrable, the set of step functions just is not dense in $L^1(X,\mu)$, so taking 'step functions' will cause serious accounting problems...

First things first. We want to prove a more general assertion $$f(x)g(x)\leq ||f||\,||g||,\quad\forall x\in [0,1]\tag{1}$$ Once we've shown that $(1)$ holds $$\sup_{x\in [0,1]}f(x)g(x)\leq ||f||\,||g||=\||fg||\tag{2}$$ Having said that: Fix $x\in [0,1]$. Since $\sup_{x\in [0,1]} |f(x)|\leq ||f||$ we have that $f(x)\leq ||f||_1$. Similarly, $g(x)\leq \|g\|_1$. Hence $$f(x)g(x)\leq ||f||_1\,||g||_1$$ - For All those who come with comments telling me this is obvious : I remember it was very hard for me to see when I was a kid so you can't assume f(x) is greater than or equal to its norm.

A.373	As a European scientist, coming to a western presentation in the US often goes differently than the reverse, due to the cultural differences. Given my frequent flights between australia and the US over the past years I have been able to note this. Whether this causality goes both ways only time will tell. I have already had students respond positively to my international students, whose contributions to our research group are routinely observed and discussed. This week, I attended a one-day workshop, where interactions between speakers and attendees exploded when two different questions were asked by Amit to his audience in the main poster session. I shall share my comments below. I have been active in solving certain combinatorial number theoretic problems for over 8 years, but when I was asked to present back to the group what brings me to number theory, it was quite difficult to respond. The true reason that brings me to combinatorics and in particular discrete geometry is an exponential growth. Exponential growth always brings in a lot more science that I do not immediately see. It is almost by definition beyond our favorite choice of tools. Now, this is exactly when I’m in trouble. I’m a fundamentalist in mathematics, well maybe even too strong, but speaking alternatively if I “arrive” at a mathematical statement, I really try to lose no train of thought until I arrive to either a proof or an acceptance that this object is part of my life. As this happened to me many times in the last 8 years, I was in fact seeing a depth in these problems I did not know existed, but when one sees something like that is not hot news anymore but it really drives you out to pursue, if only as a hobby. Discrete geometry being a lay on top of combinatorics, by its definition, rarely comes across being of much relevance. Exactly because of this even those of our peers in combinatorics who tend to be active in discrete geometry or geometry, for that matter, have very little devotion to it in the start of their careers. When I arrived at the main poster session, I was scheduled to present back on Thursday. Amit would ask some other question. My uneasiness caused by this affront intensified, thinking about when I would’ve presented back to a crowd of people.

If anyone could work it out And you please include the detailed steps solution for and Hint: For the first question, write $$n=2m$$, then factor. This problem is an analog of Pell equation, but the unit we multiplied with to get a new solution from old is 37*2^23-rather than 2 (it is a bit messier). Oops, there was a typo: The unit is actually 14*2^23-1, which, admittedly, is messier still. Good work Mr. PG! You get it. Well, almost. We need to be careful about the positivity of the roots. For example, $$3=7+(-\sqrt{18})(2)=7(1 - \sqrt{18}/7)$$ Whereas when m is positive, the roots are positive: $$x_1 = -2 - \sqrt{2}$$ $$x_2 = 7m + 2\sqrt{7m^2 - 7}$$ Now for cubes: Let n be a multiple of 3, $$n = 3m$$ $$x^2 + 7 = 2^{3m} = 8^m$$ Rewrite 8 as $$2^3$$ to yield: $$x^2 - 2^{6m-6} = 7(2^m - 1) \quad (x = 2^{3p})$$ This is according to [URL]http://people.ucsc.edu/pak/primes2.pdf[/URL] Table 3.10 beginning on page 43.

A.378	The question, of course, is after which function $\sqrt{\left(-3\right)^2}$ can be reduced, and not which absolute value function yields the given value. NOW you see the need for BOTH negative and positive radicand signs, the convention being $\sqrt{}$ always implies the positive root. An equation involving both negative and positive roots can be redundantly split into two with a positive and negative in each. Back to the question now. I look at the radicand, two thirds, of the squared negative three as a first factor $\left(-3\right)$ to an exponent one half exponent. Write it as $\left(-3\right)^\frac{1}{2}$ multiplied by $\left(-3\right)^\frac{1}{6}$. The first $\left(-3\right)^\frac{1}{2}$ is ambiguous whether the $\sqrt{%}$ symbol means absolute value or standard root, the second $\left(-3\right)^\frac{1}{6}$ is unambiguously a $6^{th}$ root. $6$ is $2$ times $3$ while root $2$ is the limit of a scale factor such as ${\langle4,5,6\rangle}^{%}$ where $5$ is very nearly twice $4$ and six is very nearly three times four, and so on for higher n$^\text{th}$ roots. In this example, $3$ is very nearly two times $5$(-ish) anyway because, after all, three to the two power is nine and one half equals nine, almost. So with limits granting specified positive and negative roots, this is half half two times five and not one half sixths root. ### Microquestions $\left(-3\right)^\frac{1}{2}$ means the positive $\sqrt{−3}$ value and not the negative one. In both cases note the limit required. ### More interesting The above is just a trivial example. An paradox with negative values, which can be avoided with attention to real exponent values.

This exercise shows the different approaches to compute the variance of a population. Instructions A study shows that test taking college students spend two hours per night studying. So, the mean amount of time studying per student is about two hours, which is the center distribution , or central tendency. In addition, the study shows that some students study 0 hours, some students study 2 hours, some students study 4 hours, and so on, as illustrated by the scatter diagram in the figure. There is an amount of variation of the population shown by the scatter diagram. We can think of this variation as the amount of risk associated with test taking especially as an entry-level activity in a college. There are many methods to measure this amount of variation including using the range, the IQR, the five-number summary, and computing the variance and standard deviation. Of these methods, the method used to compute the amount of variation will affect how we perceive the measurement and how we will interpret it. This exercise uses an empirical dataset with an evenly spaced sample of 24 values to represent the population. The dataset includes an original column (Sample) and six additional columns for computation. Results State the specific results of your calculations.

The construction I have in mind is... a disc of radius r is inscribed in a semicircle. A line by symmetry connects the center of the semicircle to the midpoint of the circle. The angle that subtends the semicircle is 180, just like the angles in a straight line So I also have no idea what I should do :( Any help is truly appreciated! Thanks!

For example, consider $$f_0(n) = \begin{cases} \binom{n}{1} & \mbox{for }n=3k\\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise. } \end{cases}$$ $$f_1(n) = \begin{cases} f_0(\frac{n}{3}) & \mbox{for }n=3k\\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise. } \end{cases}$$ $$f_2(n) = \begin{cases} f_1(\frac{n}{3}) & \mbox{for }n=3k\\ 1 & \mbox{if n=1}\\ 0 & \mbox{otherwise. } \end{cases}$$ I've "extended" the domain of $f_2(n)$ from $\mathbb N\cup\{0\}$ to $\mathbb R$. This is purely for convenience so we can do analysis. Suppose that $$X_{0} = \{P\in \{0,1\}^{\mathbb N}:P_{3k}=0~\forall k\geq 0\}$$ $$Q_{0}^{s} = P_{0}^{(s)}$$ We can also consider the 1-dimensional Hilbert cube $[0,1]^{\mathbb N}$ so we can identify the elements of $X_0$ as elements of $[0,1]^{\mathbb N}$ by prepending a string of 0's to each element of $X_0$ so let $X$ be the set of such elements, i.e. $$X=\{0\}^{\mathbb N_{>0}} \times X_{0}$$ That way, $P\mapsto Q$ becomes a $(1,1)$ transformation of the cube. # Drawing 6 points: collinearity-an elementary approach

A.387	Changes from A-Original post to A- This is a practice exercise of proving that every positive integer greater than $11$ is a non-negative linear combination of $5$ and $4$. My solution Let $n\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}$, therefore there exists $k\in\mathbb{Z}_0^+$, so that $n=5k + i, i\in\{0,1,2,3,4\}$. Now analyzing cases we have: If $i=0$, then $\begin{align*} n = 5k \Rightarrow n = 5k + 4(0) \end{align}$ If $ i = 1 $, then $\begin{align*} n & = 5k + 1 \\ & = 5k-5(3) +5(3) +1 \\ & = 5(k-3) + 15 + 1 \\ & = 5(k-3) +16 \Rightarrow n = 5(k-3) +4(4). \end{align*} $If $ i = 2 $, then $\begin{align*} n & = 5k + 2 \\ & = 5k-5(2) +5(2) +2 \\ & = 5(k-2) + 10 + 2 \\ & = 5(k-2) +12 \Rightarrow n = 5(k-2) +4(3). \end{align*} $If $i=3$, then $\begin{align*} n & = 5k + 3 \\ & = 5k-5 + 5 + 3 \\ & = 5(k-1) +8 \Rightarrow n = 5(k-1) +4(2). \end{align*} $If $i=4$, then $\begin{align*} n = 5k + 4 \Rightarrow n = 5k + 4(1). \end{align*} Thus, every positive number can be expressed as a linear combination of $5$ and $4$. Now using that $n>11$, therefore we have: $\begin{align*} n &> 11 \\ 5k + i &>
