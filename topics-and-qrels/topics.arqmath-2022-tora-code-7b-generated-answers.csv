A.301,"The proof can be divided into two parts: \strong{1) For square matrices} We know that $\|A\|_2^{2}=\sum_{i,j} |a_{i,j}|=\rho(A^TA)$ and $\|A\|_{\infty}=\max_{i,j} |a_{i,j}|$, so $\|A\|_2\leq \sqrt{\rho(A^TA)}=\sqrt{\max_{i,j} |a_{i,j}|^2}$. Since the expression inside the square root is maximized when $i=j$, we have $\|A\|_2\leq \sqrt{\max_{i=j} |a_{i,j}|^2}=\sqrt{\rho(A^TA)}$. We also know that $\|A\|_1=\sum_{i} |a_{i,1}|=\rho(A^T)$, so $\|A\|_1\leq \sqrt{\rho(A^TA)}$. Combining these gives $\|A\|_2\leq \sqrt{\|A\|_1 \|\cdot \sqrt{\rho(A^T A)}$. \strong{2) For rectangular matrices} Now consider a $m\times n$ matrix $A$, we know that $\|A\|_2^{2}=\sum_{i,j} |a_{i,j}|=\rho(A^TA)$ and $\|A\|_{\infty}=\max_{i,j} |a_{i,j}|$, so $\|A\|_2\leq \sqrt{\rho(A^TA)}$ again by the maximization argument. But now the expression inside the square root is minimized when $i\neq j$, and for some indices $i,j$, $a_{i,j}=a_{1,1}=\|A\|_{\infty}$, so $\|A\|_{\infty}\leq \frac{\|A\|_2}{\sqrt{n}}$. This gives $\|A\|_2\leq \frac{\sqrt{\rho(A^TA)}{\sqrt{n}}$. Combining these gives $\|A\|_2\leq \sqrt{\|A\|_1 \|\cdot \frac{\rho(A^T A)}{\sqrt{n}}$. This conclusion holds for both square and rectangular"
A.302,"\begin{blockquote} An $n$-th root of a complex number $z$ is a complex number $w$, such that $z^n = w$. The question is to show that for each positive real number $s$ and each integer $n$, the equation $z^n = w$ has exactly one solution, given by $w = \sqrt[n]{s}e^{i\frac{\phi}{n}$. \end{blockquote} Comment: I presume you're using $\phi$ for the argument of $w$, in which case the problem is asking to show that for each $s \ge 0$ and each integer $n$, there is exactly one $w = \sqrt[n]{s} e^{i \frac{\phi}{n}$ such that $z^n = w$ has exactly one solution. This is true because $e^{i \frac{\phi}{n}$ is a unit complex number, and thus the $n$-th root of any complex number is also a unit complex number (with the possible exception of $n = 0$), and the $n$-th root of a positive real number is always positive. Comment: I apologize for the confusion. I will edit the question. Answer: The number of solutions to $z^n = w$ where $z$ and $w$ are complex and $n$ is a positive integer is always either $1$ or $0$. This follows from the fact that the set of complex numbers of the form $z^n$ form a circle in the complex plane, and the set of complex numbers of the form $w$ are the points on the unit circle in the complex plane. Since the circle does not intersect the unit circle except at $1$ (unless $n = 0$), there is at most one solution. And there is exactly one solution when $w = \sqrt[n]{s}e^{i\frac{\phi}{n}$, assuming $s \ge 0$ and $\phi$ is some real number.</s>"
A.303,"Thanks Comment: By the way, welcome to MathOverflow! It's a good practice to use MathJax (https://math.stackexchange.com/help/notation) to write down your questions and answers, rather than typing them in plain text. Answer: The adjoint representation of the non-abelian Lie algebra with basis $x, y$ is determined by the map $$\begin{align*} [x, y] & \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \end{align*} which is not of the form $$\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} $$ with $ad - bc = 1$ and $a, b, c, d$ commuting. Thus, the only possible Lie algebras are given by $x \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $y \mapsto \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$, which are isomorphic.</s>"
A.304,"Answer: From the point of view of topological category theory, a \em{quasi-complex structure} on a real 2-manifold $X$ means that the structure group of $X$ is an open subset of $GL(2,\mathbb{R})$, which is not compact. But every open subset of $GL(2,\mathbb{R})$ is a compact subset of $GL(2,\mathbb{C}$, and hence $X$ would have to be orientable. In fact, one can find this argument in a more elementary context in Theorem 4.1.13 of the book \em{Geometry of Surfaces}, by Singer and Thorpe.</s>"
A.305,"Comment: The floor function is $1$, because the sum of the series $\frac{1}{2^r}$ from $r=1$ to $N$ is less than $1$ for all natural numbers $N$, and greater than or equal to $1$ for $N=1$. Since the floor function is constant for a given $N$, it cannot change the value as $N$ goes to infinity. So, $\lfloor\sum_{r=1}^N\frac{1}{2^r}\rfloor = \lfloor 1 \rfloor = 1$. Comment: @AlfredYan : The floor of a sum of rationals is always an integer. The sum of the sequence $1/2^r$ from $r=1$ to $N$ increases without bound but is always less than 1. As $N \to \infty$, it must be $0$, and since $\lfloor 0 \rfloor = 0$, that's the limit. Answer: The floor function is constant for a given $N$, so $\lim_{N \to \infty} \left\lfloor \sum_{r=1}^N \frac{1}{2^r} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{1}{2} \right\rfloor = 1$. Comment: But OP asked for the floor of the limit. If the limit is $\frac{1}{2}$, we would use the definition of the limit to show that the floor is 1, but as it's 0 for all N above 1, we can say that the floor is 0.</s>"

As $GF(n)$ is an Abelian group under multiplication modulo $n$, every element $a$ has an inverse $a^{-1}$ such that $a^{-1}a \equiv 1 \pmod n$. Thus, by Lagrange's theorem, every element in $GF(n)$ has an orbit of length $t$ that lies in the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, \lambda(n)$, and $\lambda(n)$ is the maximum of these possible lengths. Furthermore, if $\operatorname{ord}_n(a) = t$, then $a^t \equiv 1 \pmod n$, so $\lambda(n)$ is the largest such $t$ for which $a^t \equiv 1 \pmod n$. \end{blockquote} Comment: This is the exact quote, is it not? It gives a quite mathematical proof. So, I am failing to see the problem.

But it is clear that for any positive integer $t$, there is an $x$ such that $x^{t}$ is congruent to 1 modulo $n$, because $GF(n)$ is a cyclic group under multiplication. In other words, the elements of $GF(n)$ all have orders that divide $n$, and the order of $x$ is a divisor of $n$. Thus, the largest such order $t$ is when $t$ is a divisor of $n$.

A.308,"This question was asked by a student in Riemann's 1859 paper and we still don't have a satisfactory answer. I am having trouble understanding Riemann's definition of the zeta function, and I will need to give a brief summary here before I can get to my question. In his 1859 paper, Riemann derived the integral representation $$\zeta(s)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^s}=\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x-1}dx$$ that is valid for $\mbox{Re}(s)\gt 1$, and then modified the integral in order to define a function that is defined for all complex values of $s$, except $s=1$, where it has a simple pole. The extension is given by $$\zeta(s)=\frac{\Gamma(1-s)}{2\pi i}\int_C \frac{(-z)^s}{e^z-1}\frac{dz}{z}$$ where $C$ is a ""Hankel contour"", that is, a path that travels from $+\infty $ at a small distance $\epsilon$ above the positive $x$-axis, circles around the origin once in counterclockwise direction with a small radius $\delta$, and returns to $+\infty$ traveling at distance $\epsilon$ below the positive real axis. Taking the limit as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$ and $\delta \rightarrow 0$ one can see that the integral $$\int_C \frac{(-z)^s}{e^z-1}\frac{dz}{z}$$ becomes $$(e^{i\pi s}-e^{-i\pi s})\int_0^\infty\frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x-1}dx$$ and then the rest follows easily from known identities satisfied by the Gamma function. While the original real integral over $[0,\infty)$ is clearly divergent if $\mbox{Re}(s)\leq 1$, the contour integral over $C$ is defined for all complex $s$, because the path stays away from the singularity at $s=0$ and from the branch cut along the positive $x$-axis.

If $\overline{\text{span}\{x_n\}}$ were a proper subspace of $H$, then there would be some vector $y \in H$ orthogonal to all of the $x_n$, but not in $\overline{\text{span}\{x_n\}}$, which would contradict the Parseval's identity $\sum_n |(x_n, y) |^2 = |y, y|,$ since $|y, y| = 1$ (since $y$ is orthogonal to all $x_n$, it must be orthogonal to the whole sequence $x_n$). Therefore, $\overline{\text{span}\{x_n\}}$ equals $H$. Answer: The result is not true as stated. I will provide a counter-example. In $\ell^2(\mathbb{N)$, consider the orthonormal basis $(e_n)$ where $e_n(n)=1$ and $e_n(m)=0$ for $m \neq n$. We have $\sum_n\|e_n-x_n\|=\sqrt{n}$.

This follows from the fact that the order of an element in a group $G$ is the least common multiple of the orders of its generators. The generators of $\mathbb{Z}/2^m\mathbb{Z}$ are the non-trivial elements of the form $2^k$ for $k=0,1,\ldots,m-1$ and the order of these is $2^k$. The least common multiple of their orders is $2^{m-1}$. This follows from the fact that $\gcd(2^0,2^1,\ldots,2^{m-1}) = 2^{m-1}$. Another way to see this is to observe that the group $\mathbb{Z}/2^m\mathbb{Z}$ is is isomorphic to the direct sum of $m$ copies of $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$, which is is a group of exponent $2$ (generated by $1$). The units in a group of exponent $n$ are the elements of order $n$. This property holds for any integer $m$.

I found a pattern and that's why I was confused with the result (2.5, 5, 10, 17.5...). Now I need to find the pattern for the sum of triangular numbers. Answer: The triangular numbers are defined as $T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. The sum of the triangular numbers from 1 to n is $\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}$. This is because the sum of an arithmetic series is given by the formula: $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d)$, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference and n is the number of terms. The first term is 1 and the common difference is 2. So, for the sum of the triangular numbers from 1 to n, we have: $S_n = \frac{n}{2}(2\frac{1}{2} + (n-1)\frac{2}{2}) = \frac{n(n+2)}{4}$ This is also equal to: $S_n = \frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}$, because $\frac{2}{2}$ and $\frac{2}{4}$ are the coefficients for n and (n+1) in the triangular number S.P.I.</s>"

A.325,"I am trying to find $100$ consecutive composite numbers. According to the problem, the first number in the sequence must be $2$, and the last one must be less than $1000$. If we denote the $n$-th composite number as $P_n$, then $P_1 = 2$ and $P_{n+1} = P_n + n!$. For a number to be composite, it must be divisible by at least 2 (since it must be even), and by at least 3 (since it must be divisible by 3 or 2 and 3 is a divisor of 2). Thus, $P_{n+1} = P_n + n!$ must be divisible by at least 2 and 3. Also, we must have $P_n < 1000$. From the conditions, we can derive the following recurrence relation: \begin{align*} P_1 &= 2, \\ P_{n+1} &= P_n + n!, \text{ and } P_{n+1} \text{ is composite if } P_n + n! \text{ is composite}, \end{align*} and $P_n < 1000$. From this, we can observe a cycle: $2, 6, 4!, 8, 6!, 10, 8!, \ldots$. Each term leads to the next term by multiplication by 2 or 4 (since $n!$ increases by 2 every two terms). After $n = 4$, the cycle repeats. Therefore, we need $n < 4$. So, $n! = 1, 2, 1, \ldots, 1$. Hence, $n = 1$. This gives us $2, 3, 4, \ldots$. There are $25$ such numbers in total.

By the Mean Value Theorem, there is a $\xi\in(0,1)$ such that $f'(\xi)=0$, which means that $4^\xi+6^\xi=9^\xi$. But $4^\xi$ and $6^\xi$ are of the form $4^a$ and $6^a$ with $a<1$, and by the AM-GM inequality, $4^a6^a\ge (4+6)^a=10^a$. Taking the logarithms, we get $a\ge \log_{10}(4)+a\ge \log_{10}(2.5)$, so $a=\log_{10}(4)+1=\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $\xi=\frac{1}{2}$ and $x=\log_{10}(2.5)$. By the power tower rule, $(4/9)^\xi=(4/9)^{1/2}=2/3$ and $(6/9)^\xi=(6/9)^{1/2}=3/4$. Adding, we get $2/3+3/4=1$. Hence, the root of $4^x+6^x=9^x$ is $\frac{1}{2}$.

And you should never write ""BWOC"" unless it's in the context of Breakdown of Clocks (which is a bad joke). Comment: I am not sure how to solve this problem formally.

The prime factor theorem says that any positive integer big than 1 can be expressed as a product of primes, but I don't see how it can directly imply that g(n) = n/L(n). I would appreciate some hint or a detailed solution. Answer: Let $L(n)$ be the least prime factor of $n$ as you've defined it, and let $g(n)$ be the greatest positive integer such that $g(n) \mid n$. We want to show that $g(n) = \frac{n}{L(n)}$. If $n$ isprime, then $g(n) = 1$, so $\frac{n}{L(n)} = \frac{n}{n} = 1$. Otherwise, by the prime factorization of $n$, $n$ can be written as a product of primes $p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \cdots p_k^{a_k}$, and the least prime factor of $n$ is $p_1$. Therefore, $g(n) = p_1^{a_1-1} p_2^{a_2-1} \cdots p_k^{a_k-1}$, which is the product of the primes less than $n$. Since $g(n) < n$, this product is less than $n$. Therefore, $\frac{n}{g(n)} = \frac{n}{p_1^{a_1-1} p_2^{a_2-1} \cdots p_k^{a_k-1}$ is an integer less than $n$. As $p_1$ is the least prime factor of $n$, $p_1$ is also the largest prime dividing $n$, so $"

By the Law of Cosines, $P(X^2 + Y^2 = 1) = P(X^2 = \cos^2(\theta) + Y^2 = \sin^2(\theta)) = \frac{\pi}{2}$, and using the double angle formula for cosine, $2P(XY > 0) = P(X^2 + Y^2 = 1) = \frac{\pi}{2}$. Setting $X = \cos(\theta)$ and $Y = \sin(\theta)$, this yields $P(\cos^2(\theta) + \sin^2(\theta) = 1) = \frac{\pi}{2}$, which implies $P(\cos^2(\theta) = \frac{\pi}{4}$. Then, $P(XY > 0) = P(\cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) = 1 - 2p) = \frac{\pi}{2} - 2p$. Similarly, $P(XY < 0) = P(-\cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta) = 1 - 2p) = \frac{\pi}{2} - 2p$. Thus, $P(XY > 0) + P(XY < 0) = 2p$. When $p = 0$, the equation simplifies to $P(XY > 0) = \pi^{-1}\arcsin(p)$ and $P(XY < 0) = \pi^{-1}\arccos(p)$, as claimed.</s>"

A.349,"I don't think an inverse to the function $y = \sqrt{2\pi x} (\frac{x}{e})^x$ can be calculated directly because it isn't bijective (for some values of $y$ there is more than one possible $x$). For example, if $y = 1$, then $x$ could be $1$ or $\frac{1}{2}$. However, Stirling's approximation can be used to calculate $x$ from $y$ to a reasonable accuracy when $y$ is large, by observing that \[y = \sqrt{2\pi x} (\frac{x}{e})^x \approx \frac{x^x}{\sqrt{2\pi}}$. Taking the logarithm of both sides gives $\log y = x \log x + \log \sqrt{2\pi} - x \log e = x (\log x + \frac{\log 2 + \log \pi}{2} - \log e)$, which simplifies to $x = e^{\log x + \frac{\log 2 + \log \pi}{2}}$. Setting $x = e^{\frac{\log x + \log 2 + \log \pi}{2}$ equal to the given $y$ will give you an approximation for large $y$. For small $y$, you can use Newton's method or similar to find a better approximation. The accuracy with which you can calculate $x$ will depend on the accuracy of the given $y$, the larger the $y$, the better the approximation.</s>"

However, if it's not raining, the probabilities are independent. Uncorrelated random variables don't necessarily mean independent. In real life, it's hard to find two completely uncorrelated random variables. We can only find two independent random variables.

A.354,"I will try to do my best to explain my problem, hopefully it's clear enough. The prime factorization of $a$ can be written as $p_1^{a_1} * p_2^{a_2} * p_3^{a_3} * ...$ and $p_1 \mid a$ means $a_1 > 0$. $p_2 \mid a$ means $a_2 > 0$ and $p_1p_2 \mid a$ means $a_1 > 0$ and $a_2 > 0$. So in order for $p_1p_2$ to divide $a$, $a$ must have a factor of $p_1$ that is a power of $p_1$ and a factor of $p_2$ that is a power of $p_2$. Since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct primes, the only way this can happen is if $a_1 = a_2 = 1$. Therefore, $p_1p_2 \mid a$.

If you're not allowed to use Euclid's Lemma, you can use the property of distinct primes: if $p_1$ divides $a$ and $p_2$ divides $a$, then the highest power of $p_1$ that divides $a$ is less than the highest power of $p_2$ that divides $a$.

Comparing (1) with the functional equation of the constant function $f(x) = a$, we obtain $a^2 + a = ax + 1$. For this equation to hold for all $x$, $a = 1$. Therefore, $f(x) = 1$ is the only solution. We further check that $f(f(x)^2 + f(y)) = xf(x) + y$ for all $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$ when $f(x) = 1$. However, this equation does not hold when $x = y = 0$, yielding $1 + 1 = 1$, which is obviously false. So, $f(f(x)^2 + f(y)) \neq xf(x) + y$ for $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$.

This is a very simple class of functions, but it doesn't seem to capture the essence of the problem. A more interesting class of functions would be those which are polynomial functions, i.e. functions of the form $f(n)=c_0+c_1n+c_2n^2+\cdots+c_kn^k$ for some constants $c_0, c_1, \ldots, c_k$ and some integer $k$. These polynomials are determined by the values of $a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_k$, and we can see from the problem that for the series $(2,4,\ldots)$ the only polynomials of degree 1 or less will do, because the $a_n$ are distinct. So, we have $\boxed{2}$ functions: $f(n)=2n$ and $f(n)=n^2-n+2$. For the series $(3,1,4,1,5,\ldots)$, we have $2$ functions: $f(n)=3n$ and $f(n)=n^2-n+1$. It is not difficult to see that this will generalize to any sequence of distinct terms in the series. For a sequence of $m$ distinct terms $(a_n)$, the degree of the polynomial representing the series is $m-1$, and there are $m$ constants to determine. So, the number of functions is $m$.

This means that for any $\epsilon>0$, there exist a partition of $[a,b]$ such that the sum of the differences of the upper and lower Darboux sums is less than $\epsilon$. Since the function $f$ is bounded, it is continuous on the interior of $[a,b]$, and therefore, the function $F(x)=\int_a^xf(t)dt$ is also continuous on the interior of $[a,b]$.

We can rewrite this equation as $(x - y\sqrt{d})(x + y\sqrt{d} = 1$, and it is clear that the integer solutions to this equation are of the form $(x, y) = (\pm 1, \pm\sqrt{d})$ or $(\pm\sqrt{d}, \pm 1)$. One can show that these are the only integer solutions to the equation, and this allows us to define the ring of integers for $\mathbb{Q}\left[\sqrt{d\right]$, which is $\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1 + \sqrt{d}}{2}$. Then we can say that $\left(\sqrt{d}\right)$ is a uniformizing element and its conjugate $\left(-\sqrt{d}\right)$ is its multiplicative inverse, and these two elements generate the ring of integers. This is known as the ring of integers of $\mathbb{Q}\left[\sqrt{d\right]$, denoted $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q\left[\sqrt{d}\right]}$. It seems to me that working in this ring offers little additional insight, as we still have the integer solution $(x, y) = (\pm 1, \pm\sqrt{d}$, and if we work in $\mathbb{Z}\left[\sqrt{d}\right]$, we get the same result. Furthermore, I don't understand why we choose to work in $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}\left[\sqrt{d\right]}$ as opposed to a more natural definition, which would be $\mathbb{Z}\left[\sqrt{d}\right]$.

A.379,"1) Let $G$ be a group. The set of all isomorphisms $f: G \to G$ is a group under composition. To show this we need to verify that the group axioms are met, i.e., that each $f \in S$ has an inverse in $S$ , and that $S$ is non-empty (since $id \in S$), and that if $f, g \in S$ then $fg \in S$. We note that if $f \in S$, then $f$ is a function from $G$ to $G$ that is a isomorphism, i.e., a bijective function. Hence, $f^{-1} : G \to G$ is also a bijection, so $f^{-1} \in S$. Therefore, $ f^{-1 } \circ f \in S $, and $f \circ f^{-1} = id \in S$, hence $S$ is a group. As for the element of order 1, if $f : G \to G$ is an isomorphism, then $f(G) = G$ or $|G| = 1$, so every element of $G$ has order 1 or 2. Answer: The last part of your solution seems correct to me, but for the rest I would do the following: i) Let $f_1, f_2 \in S$.

Because the sine and cosine functions are orthogonal on a complete period, this implies that $f(t) = 0$ for all $t \in [0, \pi]$. Since $f$ is continuous, it must be identically zero. In other words, if $f(x)$ satisfies the condition $\int^{\pi}_{0}f (t) \sin(t)dt =\int^{\pi}_{0} f (t) \cos(t)dt = 0$, then $f(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [0, \pi]$.

Answer: I will consider the case $|a| < 1$ and $|a| \neq 1$ (the case $|a| = 1$ is not so interesting because then $f_a(z) = z - a$ which clearly does not map the unit disk into itself). First, note that $|f_a(z)|^2 = |z - a|^2 + |1 - \overline{a}z|^2 \leq |z|^2 + |a|^2|z|^2 = |z|^2 ( 1 + |a|^2 ) = |z|^2$ by the triangle inequality, since $|a|^2 < 1$. Hence, $|f_a(z)| \leq |z|$. But $f_a(z) = \frac{z - a}{1 - \overline{a}z}$ is holomorphic and its derivative $f_a'$, which is given by $\frac{1 - \overline{a}}{(1 - \overline{a}z)^2}$, is also holomorphic and its module is less than one because $|a| < 1$ and it has no roots. Therefore, by the maximum/minimum principles, $f_a$ maps the unit disk into itself. To see this, let $z \in D(0, 1)$ and $w \in D(0, 1)$, then \[|f_a(z) - f_a(w)| = |(z - a) - (w - a)| \leq |z - w|"

A.388,"Please, any help will be really appreciated. I've been trying echelon form where i switched $R_1$ with $R_3$ and then i switched $R_2$ with $R_3$ So I have $\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&10&-6&1\\1&k&-1&2\\2&-1&k&5\end{array}\right]$ but then I'm stuck and don't know how to get any further. I don't know what to do next Comment: Please, any help will be really appreciated. I've been trying echelon form where i switched R1 with R3 and then i switched R2 with R3 So I have [1 10 -6 1; 1 k -1 2; 2 -1 k 5] but then I'm stuck and don't know how to get any further. Comment: The system has no solution when $k=\frac{10}{3}$ and $\frac{10}{3}\neq \frac{2}{3}$, otherwise it has a unique solution. The conditions for the system to have no solution are $rank(A)=rank(A')=n-1$, where $A'$ is the row-echelon form of $A$ and $n$ is the number of equations. Here, $n=3$. But I'm not sure how to find the value of k algebraically. Answer: (a) If the system has no solution, then the rank of the coefficient matrix of the system $A$ must be less than the rank of its row echelon form $A'$. However, the rank of $A$ is 3 (since all rows are linearly independent) and the rank of $A'$ is 2 (since the first two rows are linearly dependent). Therefore, $\frac{10}{3} \neq \frac{2}{3}$, which is the condition for the system to have no solution. (b) If the system has a unique solution, then the rank of $A$ and $A'$ must be equal. This occurs when the determinant of $A$ is zero. But the determinant of $A$ is $1"
A.389,"The series $\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{i}{r^i}$ converges to $\frac{N}{1-r}$ as $N \to \infty$ provided that $|r| < 1$, and that $N$ is large enough that $(1 + r) / r^2$ is close to 1, meaning $|r| < 1$ and $N >> 1$. If $N$ is not large enough, or $r$ is close to 1, then the series does not converge to a simple expression. If $N$ is large enough, then the sum becomes $\frac{(1 + r)^{N + 1} - rN}{r^2}$, which has the limit $\frac{1}{1 - r}$. However, in some books (like Gradshteyn and Ryzhik) we see this formula for the sum: \begin{align} \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{i}{r^i} &= \frac{1}{1 - r} \left( \frac{1}{1 - r^2} \right)^N \end{align} I have two questions: \begin{itemize} \item How can we derive this formula? \item The series converges to $\frac{n}{1-r}$ as $n\to\infty$, but how do we determine the value of $n$ for which this happens? \end{itemize} Answer: For the summation of the series to converge, $|r| < 1$ and $N$ must be large enough that $(1 + r) / r^2$ is close to 1. If $|r| > 1$, then the terms don't even go to zero, so the sum doesn't converge. If $|r| < 1$, then the series converges to $\frac{1}{1 - r} \left( \frac{1}{1 - r^2} \right)^N$ as $N \to \infty$. This follows from the formula for the sum of an geometric series: \[ \sum_{i=1}^N ar^i = a \frac{1 - r^N}{1 - r} \] where $a = 1$ and $r"
A.391,"In the first case, for $0 < r \le 1$, by Jensen's inequality, we have \[\mathbb{E} |X+Y|^r \le \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{\frac{1}{r}} \left( \mathbb{E} |X|^r + \mathbb{E} |Y|^r \right).\] Then, taking into account that $0 < r \le 1$, \[\mathbb{E} |X+Y|^r \le \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^{1-\frac{1}{r}} \left( \mathbb{E} |X|^r + \mathbb{E} |Y|^r \right) = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( \mathbb{E} |X|^{\frac{1}{r}} + \mathbb{E} |Y|^{\frac{1}{r} \right).\] We know that for expectation, $\mathbb{E} |X|^{\alpha} = (\alpha \mathbb{E} X)^\alpha$ and $\mathbb{E} |Y|^{\alpha} = (\alpha \mathbb{E} Y)^\alpha$, for any real number $\alpha \ge 0$. Therefore, \[\mathbb{E} |X+Y|^{\frac{1}{r}} \le \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \left( (\frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E} X^{\frac{1}{r}} + \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E} Y^{\frac{1}{r}} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{4} \right) \left( \mathbb{E} X + \mathbb{E} Y \right) = \frac{1}{4} (\mathbb{E} X + \mathbb{E} Y),\] and since $0 < r \le 1$, the power of $2$ in the middle bracket is $\frac{1 - r}{r}$, therefore $\frac{1}{4} (\mathbb{E} X + \mathbb{E} Y) \ge \frac{1}{2}$, proving the inequality.

A.394,"\begin{align*} f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{rl} 0, & \text{if $x$ is irrational} \\ \frac{1}{n}, & \text{if $x = m/n$} \end{array} \right. \end{align*} Suppose that $x$ and $a$ are irrational numbers. For any real number $a$, the sequence $(a+n)\frac{1}{n}$ converges to $a$ as $n \to \infty$, so $x = a$ is a limit point of the sequence $(a+n\frac{1}{n})$ for all irrational $a$. Therefore, $f(a) = 0$ and $f(x) = \frac{1}{n}$ for all $x = m/n$ with $m \in \mathbb{Z}$. Therefore, $f$ is continuous at $a$ if and only if $f(a) = 0$, which is true because $f(a) = 0$ for all $a$ that are not in the sequence $(a+n\frac{1}{n})$. Comment: Can you provide the exact statement you are trying to prove? And where are you stuck at exactly? Comment: It would also be very helpful if you could provide a proper citation for this problem, so we can refer to the material you are working off. Comment: f(x) = 1/n for all x = m/n with m in Z. We want to show the function is continuous for all irrational x. Comment: The question? You have a sequence $a_n = (a+n)1/n$ converging to a, and want to show that $f(a) = 0$. This is not what I am trying to do. For all m in Z f(m/n) = 1/n, but I want to show this is close to 0 for all irrational x. Comment: @JoeKovach So you're trying to show continuity of the function $f$ at all irrational $a$ using the epsilon-delta definition? Comment: Yes"
A.399,"Let $A = \{(a,b,c,d) \ | a \leq x \leq b , c \leq y \leq d\}$ be the set of all axis-aligned rectangle, for all $a, b, c, d \in \mathbb{R}$, with $a < b$ and $c < d$. If $a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4$, then $(1,2,3,4) \in A$, and if $a=\frac{1}{2}, b=\frac{3}{2}, c=\frac{5}{2}, d=\frac{7}{2}$, then $(\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{2},\frac{5}{2},\frac{7}{2}) \in A$, and so on. Every real number in $\mathbb{R}$ can be written as a fraction in lowest terms, and since the fractions are dense in $\mathbb{R}$, it follows that $A$ is countable. Is thisproof correct? If it is not, how can I properly prove it? Any help would be appreciated. Answer: The correct way to construct a countable set out of an uncountable set is to use the concept of a diagonal process. Consider the set $A = \{(a,b,c,d) | a < b < c < d \in \mathbb{R}\}$. This set is uncountable because it contains an interval for each $a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$, and the union of all these intervals would cover $\mathbb{R}^2$. However, any countable set is a subset of some interval of the form $(a,b) \times (c,d)$, so we can find a countable set $B = \{(a_n,b_n,c_n,d_n) | n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $A \subset \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty (a_n,b_n) \times (c_n,d_n)$. To do this, we can use the diagonal process: choose a rational $a_n$ and $b_n$ such that $a_n < b_n$, and a rational $c_n$ and $d_n$ such that $c"
A.400,"I'm stuck on this one, any help would be really appreciated. \begin{blockquote} In a singleelimination tournament, the probability that two particular players will play each other is given by $$\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$$ where $n$ is the number of players. In the case of 16 players, $n=16$, this simplifies to $\frac{1}{15}$. This is because there are $\boxed{16}$ players and to play each other, one of them must win 15 matches and the other 15 matches. The player who wins 15 matches will have $\boxed{15}$ choices (since only 1 player can win 15 matches and the other must win 0 matches), and the other player can win in $\boxed{15}$ ways. So the total ways is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2^{15}}$.} The probability in the case of $2^n$ players is $\frac{1}{2^n-1}+\frac{2^n-2}{2^n-1}\left(\frac{1}{2^{n-2}\right)^2}$. For 16 players, it simplifies to $\frac{1}{16-1}+\frac{16-2}{16-1}\left(\frac{1}{4\right)^2}=\frac{15}{16}=\frac{1}{2^{15}-2}$. \end{blockquote} This is where I'm stuck. Can someone please show me the steps to get from $\frac{1}{2^n-1}+\frac{2^n-2}{2^n-1}\left(\frac{1}{2^{n-2}\right)^2}$ to $\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}$. Answer: In a single-elimination tournament, the probability that two particular players will play each other is $\frac{1}{2^{n-1}$. In the case of 16 players, $n=16$. The total number of ways for the players to play each other is $\frac{1}{2^{15}}=\frac{1}{32^8}$. The cases where the winner of the quarter-finals plays in the semi"
