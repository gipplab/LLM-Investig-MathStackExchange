A.302	A complex number $w=a+bi$, where $a,b$ are real, has $n$th roots if and only if $n$ is a divisor of the�fpgun $2 \pi w$ (Added after the last edit) $n$th roots of $w$ exist if the multiplicative order of $w$ acts trivially on the factors $(a+bi)^m$, for each $m=1,2,\dots,n-1$. So, if the number has $n$ distinct factors, then it has $n$ roots. If not, it has 1 root. When $n$ is a divisor of $2 \pi w$ (which means the calling it a $n$th power makes sense, then it has $n$ roots, else, only one, and this is given in the above formula. If $n$ is a divisor of $2 \pi w$, the $n$th roots are $\sqrt[n]{a+bi}$. If not, only one, and that is $$(\sqrt[n]{a+bi)=e^{\frac{m \pi i}{n}\cdot \frac{1}{2}}$$ where $m$ is the smallest positive integer such that $(a+bi)^m \neq 1$ (This can be determined by looking at the powers of $a+bi$) Let $w=ae^{i\theta}$, where $a>0$ and $\theta \in \mathbb{R}$. Then $w^n=a^n e^{n\theta i}$. So, comparing real and imaginary part, $$a^n \cos n\theta = a^{1/2}\cos \frac{n\theta}{2}=e^{\frac{n \pi i}{2}$ If $a^n=1$, roots are $$\sqrt[n]{e^{n\theta\cdot \frac{1}{2}}e^{\frac{1}{2}i}=e^{\frac{(n+1)\pi}{4}i}$$ If $a^n=-1$, roots are $\sqrt[n]{e^{n\theta\cdot \frac{1}{2}}e^{-1}=\sqrt{-1}e^{\frac{n\pi i}{4}=i}$$ If $a$ is positive, it
A.303	Let's consider the bilinear form on $V$ be represented by a $2 \times 2$ matrix $A=\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix}$ such that $[x,y]=[x]=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ and $[y,x]=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ where $a,b,c,d$ are elements in $K$. So we require $A$ to satisfy 1. $[x,x]=0$ which gives $a=0,d=0$ 2. $[y,[y]=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ which gives $b=0$. Hence the matrix should be $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. Since it is not hard to guess what $c$ is we try with $c=1$. We find that $[x,y]=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}=[y,x]$ gives the desired result. A similar calculation shows that $[y,x]=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$. We claim that this is unique. Le $A=\begin{pmatrix} p & q \\ r & s \end{pmatrix}$ and consider $\begin{pmatrix} p & q \end{pmatrix}$ and $\begin{pmatrix} r & s \end{pmatrix}$ in the action of $[x,x]$. Using properties of the bracket we have $p=0, s=1$. Hence $q=-1$ and $rqs=-1$. Thus $[x,[x]=\begin{pmatrix} p & q \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$ gives $q=0$. Thus the only possibility is $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end
A.304	Answer: To me, the main idea behind the argument is the following: A non-orientable surface is a surface without a proper orientation. This means that there is no way to choose a consistent Nowhere-vanishing normal vector field on the surface. Now, a quasi-complex structure on a manifold is a choice of complex line bundle, a nowhere-vanishing normal vector field, and a connection on that bundle. In other words, a nowhere-vanishing normal vector field is the ground twist of the complex structure. If there were a quasi-complex structure, then we can choose such a structure. But we can't, therefore, there isn't one. To see this more explicitly, consider a non-orientable surface $X$. Choose a point $p$ on the surface $X$. Then, there are tangent vectors $v, w \in T_x X^2$ such that $cv$ and $dw$ do not span $T_x X^2$ for some nowhere-zero complex number $c$. (This is possible because the surface is non-orientable.) Now, if there were a quasi-complex structure, we could choose a complex line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ and a connection $\nabla$ on it such that $\nabla(cv)$ vanishes at $p$. Then, the curvature form of $\nabla$ would vanish at $p$. But this would imply that the curvature form of $\nabla$ is zero everywhere on $T_x X^2$, since $\nabla$ is a 1-form on $T_x X^2$ and the only invariant of a connection 1-form is a Riemann curvature form. But the curvature form of a connection on $T_x X^2$ is given by $F(cv, w)$, where $F$ is the curvature form associated with $\nabla$. Thus $F(cv, w) = 0$ for all $w \in T_x X^2$. However, we have $F(cv, w) = -F(v, cw)$ for all $v \in T_x X^2$. Thus, the complex line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ with connection $\nabla$ is trivial, i.e., $T_x \mathcal{L} = 0$ at
A.305	Well, as $N$ goes to infinity, all of the terms $\frac{1}{2^r$ become very small and hence the floor of the sum of the terms approaches $0$. $0<\frac{1}{2^r} <1$ for all $r$, so the floor of the sum is $\boxed{0}$. The answer is 0
A.306	By Liouville's theorem, this theorem states that if a constant is arithmetically independent of the primes then it cannot be algebraic. And since $$\sin(\pi x),$$ the Euler Mascheroni constant is arithmetically independent of all primes, it follows that that the constant cannot be algebraic. This is because if it were algebraic then the sine function would have a priori period of an odd number of digits (and hence an odd number of zeroes) at some point, which is impossible. Also, the arithmetic properties of the constant are as expected: length of a period is unchanged under addition of an integer, and is reversed under negation. That is why the constant is irrational.
A.307	Since this is a relatively old problem, please provide a reference if possible. Let $n$ be a positive integer. By definition, $\lambda(n)$ is the smallest positive integer $t$ such that $a^t\equiv1\pmod n$ for all$-$1<a$coprime to$n$. Thus, $a^t\equiv1\pmod n$ for all$a$with$\gcd(a,n)=1$. Because $1$is coprime to$n$, $a^t\equiv1\pmod n$holds for$a=1$. Therefore,\[\begin{split*} \lambda(n)&=\operatorname{ord}_n(1)\\ & =\text{min}\{\,t\in\mathbb N:\,1^t\equiv1\pmod n\text{ and }\gcd(1,n)=1 \\ & =\text{min}\{\,t\in\mathbb N:\,1^t\equiv1\pmod n\text{ and }\gcd(1,n)\ge2\quad\}=\text{min}\{\,t\in\mathbb N:\,1^t\equiv1\pmod n\text{ and }\gcd(1,n)\ge2\quad\implies\quad \[\\ &\implies\quad \lambda(n)&=\operatorname{ord}_n(1)=\boxed{1}.\end{split*}$ ru oroy (first years stackexchange answer)](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/6989034/2079336).

A.308	Answer:The Gamma function $\Gamma(s)$ has a simple pole at $s=1$, where the integral of the function $\frac1{x^{s-1}e^{-x}$ over $x=0$ is $\frac{1}{s-1}$. Thus $\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}$ performs a change of sign making it anti-periodic (becomes $-1$ if $s$ is a positive integer), which is handy to work with. The integral over $[0,\infty)$ is symmetric around the real $x$ axis, so that we can flip the contour to be in $[0,\infty)$ as $s$ changes sign, and the integral over $C$ is now from $0$ to $\infty$. The pole at $s=0$ can be avoided by taking $\epsilon$ large, and the path returns to $0$ along the positive imaginary axis, so that it does not cross it. Then as $\epsilon\rightarrow 0$, we get the limit$$\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\epsilon}^0 \frac{R^s}{e^R}{e^{-\pi R}\frac{dz}}{z}=\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\frac{R^s}{e^{-R}\int_{\epsilon}^0 \frac{dR}{R}e^{\pi R}dz}.$$Happily, $\int_{\epsilon}^0 \frac{dR}{R}=R\ln R$, so we are only left with $\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0}\frac{R^s}{e^R}=1$. This is only 0 if $s$ is not an integer, so $\zeta(s)$ is its own. Back in the tribe of $\delta$, the integral over $C$ is $$\frac{\Gamma(1-s)}{\pi i}\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x-1}dx=\frac{\Gamma(1-s)}{\pi i}\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{1-s}{e^x}dx=\boxed{\frac{(-1)^{1-s}}{s-1}\zeta(1-s)e^{-s}\Gamma(1-s)}$$ The sign cancellation is neat!
A.309	Ans: Elements $\pmod{p}$ of $x^3=a$ basically have 3 cubes in $\mathbb{F}_p$. So, if we take $3$ random elements from $\mathbb{F}_p$, say $0,1,2$, and calculate their cubes $\pmod{p$, we'll get: \begin{align*} x^3\equiv 0 \pmod{p} \Rightarrow 0^3 &\equiv 0\pmod{p} \\ x^3\equiv 1 \pmod{p} \Rightarrow 1^3 &\equiv 1\pmod{p} \\ x^3\equiv 2 \pmod{p} \Rightarrow 2^3 &\equiv 8 \pmod{p} \equiv 1\pmod{p} \end{align*}So all the cubes $\pmod{p}$ are equivalent to $1$. Now, the number $1$ has exactly $2$ distinct cubes $\pmod{p$, namely $1$ and $8$. The rest of the elements of $\mathbb{F}_p$ can be obtained by $2$ such that $a\equiv -1 \pmod{p}$, so $2\cdot p\equiv -1 \pmod{p}$. But notice that $2$ has an inverse in $\mathbb{F}_p$, specifically $2\cdot 2\cdot p\equiv 1\pmod{p}$. Multiply both sides by this number and divide both sides by $2$: \begin{align*} x^3 &\equiv 2x \equiv 1 \pmod{p}\\ x &\equiv \frac{1}{2}\pmod{p} \end{align*}Thus, the elements $x\equiv 1$ and $x\equiv 8$ are the only solutions over $\mathbb{F}_p$. But we also have the two extra solutions $\equiv -x\pmod{p}$, so we have a total of $\boxed{3}$ solutions in $\mathbb{F}_p$. The answer is 3
A.310	Assume that the fraction a on top is something more tricky to solve, such as\[\frac{4}{x} + \frac{a}{y} = 1\]It's best to start by multiplying by $10y$ so we have \[4y + axy = y.\]Then adding $a$ to both sides lets us solve for $y$. \[ \begin{array}{r r c r c r@{}l r@{}l} &=& 4y+ax&+a& 10y& = y \\ -a& = &4y& -axy \\ -a& = &4y& -a \\ \end{array}\]If $x\neq0$, we divide by $x$ to get \[y = \frac{4}{a(y-1).\]Hence the solutions for $y$ are integral multiples of $\frac{1}{a}$. The solutions for $x$ are the inverse of this, so they depend on $a$. For $4/x + 10/y = 1$, the inverse of $a$ is $4/10$, so the solutions are \[ \boxed{\{y = 1, 2, 4,8, 10}.\]The answer is 8
A.312	We know this: $$\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor \leq x < \left\lfloor x+1 \right\rfloor \Rightarrow \left\lfloor \frac{x}{c} \right\rfloor \leq \frac{x}{c} < \left\lfloor \frac{x+1 \right\rfloor $$ for $x,c \in \mathbb{Z^+$. Now let’s change up the expression, to get: $$\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor = \frac{a}{b} = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{1}{bc} \right\rfloor $$ By the above inequality applied to each expression, $$\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor \leq \frac{a}{b} < \left\lfloor \frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor \leq \frac{a}{bc}.$$ Taking the floor of both sides, $$\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor \leq \left\lfloor \frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor < \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor + 1.$$ Thus, $\left\lfloor \frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor 1 \right\rfloor,$ which implies (by the previous inequality) that $\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor$ must be a multiple of $bc.$ Hence, $$\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor a/b \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor=\left\lfloor\frac{a}{bc}\right\rfloor.$$ Let’s add $1$ to each side to get: $$\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor a/b \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \
A.313	This answer makes sense as it does not use the given information that $a$ and $b$ have orders $r$ and $s$ respectively. It rather uses the fact that their least common multiple (which is what we want to prove). Is this a valid approach? Why is it valid? why does it work? Answer: It's a valid approach, and it's a generalization of the previous approach. The given approach only used the fact that $a$ and $b$ have orders $r$ and $s$ respectively, and indirectly used the fact that $G$ is an abelian group. This approach directly uses the fact that the least common multiple of $r$ and $s$ is $rs$. Thus, it is a more direct approach and as such, this is the preferred method. The previous approach basically shows that $G$ is a cyclic group generated by $a$ and $b$, and hence the least common multiple of their orders must be the order of $ab$. Thus it is the least common multiple of $r$ and $s$ multiplied to the order of $ab$. The answer is valid. The previous approach shows that $ab$ has a cyclic order, and hence $|ab|$ divides the least common multiple of $r$ and $s$, i.e. $|ab|\mid{\rm lcm}(r,s)$. This is a more direct approach which doesn't require $G$ to be cyclic. Indeed, if $G$ is cyclic, then the order of $ab$ is the least common multiple of $a$ and $b$, and so the answer is the least common multiple of $r$ and $s$. The answer is $\boxed{\it{read}$. The answer is \it{read}
A.314	Let $y\in H$. Let $\{e_n\}$ be an orthonormal basis for $H$. Now, we consider the scalar product: $$ \begin{aligned} \langle y, e_n - \sum_{k=0}^{N} \alpha_k e_k e_n & = \sum_{k=0}^{N} \alpha_k \langle y, e_k \rangle = \sum_{k=0}^{N} \alpha_k \end{aligned} $$ Clearly, $\langle \cdot, \cdot $ is an inner product on $H$. Let $y - \sum_{k=0}^{N} \alpha_k e_k e_n$ lie in the span of $\{x_n\}$, then $$ \begin{aligned} \langle y - \sum_{k=0}^{N} \alpha_k e_k e_n, \ omega \in \ell^2 &\Rightarrow \sum_{k=0}^{N} \alpha_k \langle y - \sum_{k=0}^{N} \alpha_k e_k e_n, \omega_n = 0 \quad (\omega \in \{e_n\} ). \end{aligned} $$ Let $P$ be the projection onto the subspace spanned by $\{e_n\}$. There is a unique $r$ such that $$ \begin{aligned} P(y - \sum_{k=0}^{N} \alpha_k e_k e_n) = \sum_{k=0}^{N} \alpha_k e_k e_n = y, \end{aligned} $$ where $P$ is defined by $$ \begin{aligned} P(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{N} \alpha_k \langle e_k, x \rangle e_k. \end{aligned} $$ Note that $P$ is an operator; it is orthogonal for $P^2 = P$, and $P(e_n) = e_n$. It suffices to show that $P(\alpha_n) = 0$ for all $n$. Suppose not. Then $$ \begin{aligned} y - \
A.315	Assume $P(n\text{++})$ is true for some $n$. By definition of $P(n\text{++}$, $n>0$, so $P(n)$ is true. By H3 we have that $P(n\text{--)$ is true. But $P(n\text{--)$ implies $n\geq n$ (by definition of $P(n)$) and since $n\geq n$, $n=n$. So similarly by the principle of induction we have that $P(n\text{--)$ is true, and so for $n-1$ We have that $P(n-1)$ is true, and so on and on. Finally $n=0$ we have $P(0)$ is true. Hence the case $0$ is proven. By induction $P(m)$ is true $\forall$ $0\geq m$. The case $n=0$ and $n=n\text{++}$ is proved. Therefore the statement is $\boxed{}$true for all $0\geq m$.In the same way, the statement is true for $n\geq 0$ and holds for all $n$ forwards induction. Corollary 2.2.9: If $a$ is a natural number, then $n=0$.e supports the principle of backwards induction. Hint: bijective proof. One can use the corollary above and the axioms of natural numbers to derive the following property: H0: $0\leq n$ H1: If $n<m$ then $S(n,m)$ H2: $n\leq 0$ H3: If $n<0$ then $n+1\leq 0$ where $S(n,m)$ is symmetric in $n$ and $m$ H4: If $n=0$ then $n\leq 0$. By H0, $n< 0$ implies $S(n,k)$ for all $k<n$. One can define $0$ as $0=n+k$ for some $k\geq 0$, $0\leq k$. By H1 and H4 we have $n\leq k$, so $n=k$. By H3 we have $n-1\leq k-1
A.316	A group of integers modulo n is cyclic if and only if n is prime. All the above groups are abelian since they are products of cyclic groups of prime power orders. This implies that we can only have a cyclic group of even numbers, because the only cyclic groups of odd order are isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$. Lagrange's Theorem implies that the order of any subgroup divides the order of the group, and the only divisors of $2^{m-1}$ less than $2^m$ are $2^{m-2}$ and 1. Thus $2^{m-2}$ must be the order of an element in $(\mathbb{Z}/2^m \mathbb{Z})^*$. To this end, note that $2^{m-2}$ can be expressed in terms of powers of 2 as $2^{m-2}=2^{1 \cdot (2^{m-3)}=2^{2 \cdot (2^{m-4)}=\cdots=2^{(m-1)}$, thus we have an element of order $2^{m-2}$, and this must be the case for $(\mathbb{Z}/2^m \mathbb{Z})^*$. Indeed, $2^{m-2}$ has the form $2^k$ forsome positive integer $k$, and we can check that $k$ satisfies $2^{m-2} \le 2^k< 2^{m-1}$. When $m=3$, $k=1$ works and thus $2^{2}$ generates the whole group. Extrapolate that $2^{m-2}$ must be an element of order $2^{m-2}$ to get $2^m \equiv 1\pmod{2^m}$. Answer: As it turns out, the group structure of $(\mathbb{Z}/2^m\mathbb{Z})^*$ is $\mathbb{Z}/2^{m-2}\mathbb{Z}$ if $m\geq 2$ and $\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}$ if $m=1$. This means that you can think of each element as a binary string of length $m-1$, and perform basic arithmetic modulo $2^m$ to reduce elements in your group.
A.317	The antiderivative of $\frac1{(x^2+1)^n}dx$ can be found using substitution. We let $u=x^2+1$. Then $du=2xdx$, so when we substitute this back in for our antiderivative we have $-\frac12\int du=\frac12\ln|u-1|+C=\frac12\ln|x^2+1|$. Thusigerally, the answer to the original question is $\frac12\ln|x^2+1|+C$. – And thatained the integrals in the original posts -asy fill in the substitution $x=\tan t$, $du=\left(\sec^2tdx\right)$. Answer: $$\int \frac{1}{\left(x^2+1\right)^n}dx=\frac{1}{2}\ln |x^2+1|+\mathcal{C}$$This can be found using substitution. We use $u=x^2+1$. Then $du=2xdx$, so when we substitute back we have $-\frac12\int du=\frac12\ln|u-1|+C=\frac12\ln|x^2+1|+\mathcal{C}$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}\ln|x^2+1|+C}$. The answer is \frac{1}{2}\ln|x^2+1|+C
A.318	If $e^x \geq 1+x$, then $(e^x)^{1/n} \geq 1+\frac{x}{n}$. Because $e^{1/n}$ increases much faster than $n$, we know $\left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n} \leq e^{x}$. There are a few classes of functions $f$ for which equality holds: $a^{1/n}$ where $a$ is an integer, and $a,n$ are relatively prime, where $a$ is positive. This does not hold for $e^{x}$ and $n$. Perhaps there is a better approach: Note $\left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n} = (1+x)^n e^{-x}$, so if $a^{1/n}$ is a solution, $a=1$ and $n$ are relatively prime, so $a = \frac{p^n$, $1\leq x < p^2n$. Thus for any $a$ with this form, $a^{1/n} \geq 1+ \frac{x}{n}$. Case 1: $n$ is odd. Take $x = \ln(1+\frac{x}{n}$ as associated $a$. By AM-GM, $\sqrt{a} \geq \frac{1+x}{n} \Rightarrow \sqrt{a^{1/n} } \geq \frac{1}{n}$. This means $(1+\frac{x}{n)^{n} \geq (\sqrt{a})^{n} \geq \frac{1}{n^{1/n} \Rightarrow (\sqrt{a})^{n} \geq \frac{1}{n} = (1+x) e^{-x}$. But $n$ must be even, so equality is only possible at $n = 2$ in this case. Thus $a = 2$ and $n$ leaves remainder of $1$, so it works only for $n = 2$. Case 2: $n$ is even. Then $n = 2k$ for some $k \geq 1, a = \frac{p^k$, where $p$ is an odd prime. Note $\sqrt{a} \geq \frac{1+x}{n}$
A.319	There are several sets which are not real numbers and yet they can be used as upper bounds for the sequence of sets $A_n$. For example, consider the set of all even integers $\mathbb{Z}$ and the sequence of sets $A_n$ where each $A_n$ is the set of all integers less than $2n$. The union of all these sets $A_n$ is still uncountable, so it cannot be the union of a sequence of $\mathbb{R}$ sets.
A.320	But at this step, I get lost so I must have made a mistake.:( Answer:We can rewrite the integral as: $$\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2} \ln(\sin(t))dt$$ Also, we know that $\sin(t) = \frac{t}{2}$ for $0\leq t\leq \frac{\pi$ and the integral becomes: $$\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2} \ln(\frac{t}{2})dt$$ Now we can integrate by parts again, letting $u = \ln(t)$ and $dv = dt$. Then $du = \frac{dt}{t}$ and $v = \ln(2) + C$. The integral becomes: $$\left[\ln(t)(ln(2) - 1\right]_0^{\frac{\pi} + C = \ln{(\frac{\pi}{2} - 0) - \ln(2C) = \ln{\frac{\pi} - 2}$$ And then we have the result: $$\int_0^{\frac{\pi} \frac{1}{x}dx = \ln(\frac{\pi) - \ln(2)$$ Answer: $\boxed{\ln(\frac{\pi) - 2}$. The answer is \ln(\frac{\pi) - 2

This map is surjective since all of the $x_i$s map to some $p = f(1, 0, \cdots, 0$. This shows that $P$ is a homomorphic image of $\mathbb{Z}^n = F$. Since $F$ is free, it is a direct summand of $T$. Thus, any projective $\mathbb{Z}$-module is a direct summand of a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module. As for the first part, let $M = F$ be a free $\mathbb{Z}$-module and consider the $\mathbb{Z}$-linear map $id_M:M\to M$. Since $M$ is free, we can extend it to a homomorphism to a homomorphism $id_M: M \to P$. Then $M$ is a homomorphic image of $P$ as $id_M = P$. It seems both parts are same and they are true but I couldn't get it clearly. Please suggest if there is any mistake in my argument or if I missed anything. Proof of "Every projective module is a direct summand of free module": Let $P$ be a projective $\mathbb{Z}$-module. Consider $F = \mathbb{Z}^n$ and $T = \mathbb{Z}^m$, where $n>m$. Then we can define a $\mathbb{Z}$-linear map $f: F \to P$ such that $f(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) = x_1, 0$ for all $(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n) \
A.327	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/mwiki/...Media:Mathematics_and_P...ectors_and_audio.ogg#TheShoelace_formula. In the triangle, for the area (or rather the area of the triangle) formula of a parallelogram, substitute $l$ as $z$. Adding this to $(y-x)(z-x)$ of the determinant simplifies to $ (y-x)((y-x)h)(x-(z-x)$, which gives the answer to be $(x-y)(y-...x) = (x-y).$ But we know that the volume is $(x-y)(z-x)$ . (Therefore, the answer should be $(x-y)(z-x) = y-x $. But, as computed above, it is $(x-y)(y-x)(z-x)$. )ANSWER:Let's denote the vectors as $(x_1,x_2)$ etc. As per our assumptions in the problem, the coordinate of $l$, say $(l-x)$ is $(y,l^2)$. Also, the vectors $(x,y)$ and $(l,l^2)$ are perpendicular to the base of the parallelogram. So, by Pythagora theorem, the length of the diagonal connecting $x$ and $l$ is $(l^2-y^2)=\sqrt{(y-x)^2+(l^2-x^2)=l^2-x^2$, and so the equation to find is $(x-y)\sqrt{l^2-x^2}$. Substitute $l$ as $y$. The volume of the parallelogram is the area of the triangle, so the height $h$ is $1$. Answer$$\frac{1}{2}\begin{vmatrix} x & l y & 1 x^2 & l^2 \\ \end{vmatrix}=\frac{1}{2}(l^2-x^2)[l^2-y^2]=\frac{1}{2}(l^2-x^2)(l-y) h=\frac{1}{6}(x-y)(l^2-y^2)$$ Therefore the volume is $\frac{1
A.328	Answer:Using the formula for real numbers $\cos(2\theta)=\cos^2(\theta) - \sin^2(\theta)$, we know that $$\cos(2\theta)=\cos^2(\theta)-\sin^2(\theta) - \sin(2\theta)=-1$$. So we prove by induction that for all integers $n\ge2, \sum_{k=1}^{n}\cos\frac{2\pi k}{n}=0$. If $n=2$, the LHS is 0 as shown above. If $n=3$, we have a sum of $\cos\frac{2\pi}{3}=-\frac{1}{2}$ and a RHS of 0. Assume the statement is true for some integer $n=k$, i.e. $$\sum_{k=1}^{n}\cos\frac{2\pi k}{n}=0$$, then $$\cos\frac{2(\pi)(n+1)=\cos\frac{2\pi}{n}=-\frac{1}{2}+\cos\frac{2\pi}{k}+\cos\frac{2\pi}{k+1}$$which implies that $$\cos\frac{2\pi}{n}=\cos\frac{2\pi}{k}+\cos\frac{2\pi}{k+1}=\cos(\frac{2\pi+2\pi k)-2\pi)=\cos\frac{2\pi}{k+1}$$, which is a nonzero quantity. Thus the statement is true for $n=k+1$ and we are done. By the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all integers $n\ge2$. The answer is \strong{Mathematical induction}. The answer is \strong{\em{Mathematical induction}}.
A.329	Let $p \in A$ and $p \in U$. Since $A$ is compact, $p$ has a compact nbhd $W$ such that $W \subseteq A$ (since singletons are closed in compact spaces). Then $W$ is also open and we canів find an open set $O \subseteq W$ and a closed set $C \subseteq O$ such that $A \subseteq O$ and $O \subseteq W$. Define $V = O$. Then $A \subseteq O \subseteq \overline{O} \subseteq U$. But we need $A \subseteq V \subseteq \overline{V}$. If $x \in \overline{O}$, then $x \in O$ or $x \in \overline{O}$, if $x \notin O$, then $x \in \overline{V}$. Thus $V$ is a nbhd of $A$ and we get $\overline{V} \subseteq U$. Then $A \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U$. The answer isgenerate an open set $V$ with $A \subseteq V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U$.
A.330	\begin{align*} We look at the first row, which consists of all 1's except for the first and last entry. We can multiply the entire row by $x-a$ to get \begin{align*} x(x-a)&-a(x-a)=x^2-a^2=(x-a)[x-a]=x^2-a\end{align*} We can notice that the first column turns into all $x$'s with the same reasoning above. The determinant becomes (the product of the first row multiplied by the first column) - the product of the other combinations. Since there are $n-1$ other combinations that have $a$ in them, the answer is $x(x-a)\left(x-a\right)^{\frac{n-1}$. \begin{align*}-\frac{1}{2}\end{align*} In the original matrix, the first row becomes all $x$'s and the entire determinant becomes\begin{align*}&\left[x-a\right]^{n-1} \end{align*} Thus, our answer is $\boxed{\left[x+a\left(x-a\right)^{n-1}}$. The answer is x+a\left[x-a\right]^{n-1}
A.331	On graphing the function $y=4^x+6^x-9^x$, we find that at $x\approx 1.229$, $y$ and $y<0$. In order to determine the sign of $g(x)$, we can $$g(1.3)=(4^{1.3}+6^{1.3}-9^{1.3})>0, \ g(1)=(4^{1}-9^{1})<0, \text{and }g(0)=0.$$This graph shows that there is a local maximum at $x$, and since $g(x)$ is increasing, it must be greater than $0$ in a neighborhood of $x\approx 1.29.$ Further, $g(x)$ is concave to the left of $x=1.29$ as shown below.

A.332	I picked $1 < a,b<m = 2 < 3 < 4$. Then $n = (2)(2)(4) = 8$ and $g(n) = \frac{8}{2} = 4$. Re-arrange: We need to show that $g(n) = \frac{n}{L(n) = \left(\frac{n}{{\text{least prime p of n}\right)$. Since $n = 2$, $2|n$, and $\frac{n}{2}$ is the smallest prime of$n$. Hence$g(n) = \boxed{4}$. The answer is correct, but I'm not too sure on the format. Is there a better way?
A.333	Pass the coordinates to polar, so $X = R\cos(\Phi)$ and $Y = R\sin(\Phi)$. Then $X^2 + Y^2 = R^2 = R^2(\cos^2(\Phi) + \sin^2(\Phi) = R^2$. The mean of $X^2$ is $E[X^2] = \frac{1}{2}$ and the mean of $Y^2$ is also $\frac{1}{2}$, so $E[X^2Y^2] = \frac{1}{2}$. Thus we have, $$\begin{aligned} &\int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{1}{2} r dr \left[ \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sin^2(\phi) \right] d\phi = \int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{1}{2} R^2 dr \left[ \frac{1}{2} \cos^2(\phi) - \frac{1}{2} \sin^2(\phi\right] d\phi \\ &= \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{1} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{dr}{r} \right] \left[ \frac{1}{2} (R-\frac{1}{2}) d\phi \right] \\ &= \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{1}{2r}\right]_{r=0}^{r=1} \right] \left[ \frac{1}{2} \left[\frac{1}{2}\sin^2(\phi)\right]_{0}^{\pi} \right] \\ &= \frac{1}{4} \left(\sin(\pi) - \sin(0\right) = \frac{1}{4}. \end{aligned}$$ Now we use the projectivist's theorem to transform the integral: $$\int_{0}^{1} \int_{0}^{\pi} \frac{1}{2} r dr \left[ \
A.337	Let $\alpha$ be a parameterization of the curve $\gamma$ by an orthogonal trajectory. Then, $\alpha'(t)$ is orthogonal to $\gamma(t) = \alpha'(t) \times \alpha(0)$ and $\alpha(0)$. Let $\gamma(0) = P$. The normal vector of the curve is given by $\alpha'(0)$. The condition $\gamma(t) \cdot \gamma'(t) = \lambda(t)$ implies that $\alpha'(t) \cdot \alpha(t)$ is a scalar that means the curve is a geodesic, because $\alpha$ lies on the surface generated by the point $P$. If $\gamma(t)$ lies on the surface generated by $P$, then the operator $\gamma(t)$ is the rotation matrix for the tangent vector of $\alpha$. Hence, $\gamma'(t)$ is the coordinate vector of $\alpha$ rotated by 90 degrees clockwise, centered at the origin. Therefore, $\gamma'(t) = (\lambda(t), -\lambda(t), 0)$. Here, the curve is a rhombus, which is a straight line.
A.338	Suppose a = 4 and b = 5, and let's find all integer solutions for the equation $y = \frac{a+bx}{b-x}$. We first find that $y = \frac{a+bx}{b-x} = \frac{4+5x}{5-x} = 1+\frac{4}{5}$. Now we must solve the equation $1+\frac{4}{5} = \frac{y}{x}$. Cross-multiply to get $1x = 5y - 4$. Rearranging to get $x = \frac{5y - 4}{1} = 5$, where $x$ must be an integer. We can express 5 as 1, 10, 15, 20, and so on. Substitute $y = \frac{4+bx}{b-x} = \frac{a+5}{a-5} = \frac{4+5}{5}$ so $y$ can be -1, 8, 12, 17, 333, and so on. For $x$ to be an integer we must get $a = 5$. Thus we find that $y$ can also be -1, 8, 17, and 333. Substitute $a = 4$ back into the original equation to get $y = \frac{4+bx}{b-x} = \frac{13}{1} = 3$. Let $x = 5$ to get $y = 2$, but $x = -5$ gives $y = 6$, so $(x, y) = \boxed{(5, 3)$ and $(-5, 6)}$. Is this all the solution. Now try $a=6$ to get $y = \frac{1+6x}{6-x}$, which gives $y = 11, 2, 6, 110, 12$, so $(x,y)$ can be $(1,1), (6, 2) and (10, 10)$ Answer: (5, 3) and (-5, 6), (1, 1), (6,
A.339	Answers still want $r,s \in \mathbb{Z}$. We have that $a,b$ are relatively prime, so $gcd(a,b) = 1$. By the reverse of Bézout's lemma, there exist integers $r,s$ such that $arc + bsc = k$ for some integer k, so $kr = a \cdot b \cdot c$. Then $(ar + bs)c = akr + bsk = ac + bc = c$. Thus $a \mid c$. Let's generalise: let $gcd(a,b) = d$ and $d \mid c$, so $d = a'd' for some integers $d,d'$. Bézout's lemma gives $ad + bd'c = k$ for some $k$. Then $k = \frac{ac}{b$, so $a \mid ac \div b$. Since $d \mid c$, we have $\frac{ac}{b} \mid c$, so $a \mid ac$. There must be integers $r,s$ such that $ar + bs = \frac{ac}{b}$; then $a \mid ar + bs = 1$, so $a \mid c$. This works. I guess I don't know whether $b$ is visibly a factor of $c$. The intention was to factor $c$ and check $a$ divides each of the factors, but that seems brittle. Answer: It is likely that the wording led me to think that $b$ has to be a factor of $c$, but I had the gcd incorrect; $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, so $gcd(a,b) = 1$. Bézout's lemma can be restated as $\gcd(a,b) \cdot \gcd(b,c) = \gcd(ab, c)$, but I don't think that helps much. This is propositional - are $a,b,c$ pairwise relatively prime? If positive then since $\gcd(a,b)$ must be prime (it's got to be), $\gcd(a,b) \cdot \gcd(b,c) = \gcd(a,c
A.340	A Cauchy sequence is a sequence that, given $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a natural number N such that for all $n, m \geq N$, we have $|x_n - x_{n+1}| < \epsilon$. Given $\epsilon > 0$, we choose $N$ such that $\frac{1}{3^N} < \epsilon$. Let $m = n + 1$. For $n \geq N$, we have $|x_m - x_n| = |x_{m} - x_{m-1} + x_{m-1} - \cdots - x_1| \leq |x_{m} - x_{m-1}| + |x_{m-1} - x_{m-2}| + \cdots + |x_1| < 1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 < 3^n = \frac{3^n$. It follows that $|x_m - x_n| < \frac{1}{3^n} < \epsilon$. Done is such a sequence Cauchy? The answer is: Yes, it is Cauchy.

A.344	Answer: It seems that you're correct. The counterexample is consistent. The theorem states that any collection of subsets of a nonempty set $X$ forms a subbasis for a unique topology on $X$. In this case, $X = \{a, b, c, d, e\}$ is a nonempty set, so the collection $\mathcal{A} = \{\{a\}$ is a subbasis for a topology on $X$. However, the basis $\mathcal{B} = \{\{a\}$ means that the topology $\tau = \{\{a\}$ only contains $X$. Therefore, the topology is essentially the trivial topology, which means that every open set in the topology is also closed (because a basis element is also a closed set). But the union of the basis elements is $\{a\}$, which is not equal to $X$. Therefore, the topology is not minimal, and the theorem is not applied in this case.
A.345	Anyone can help? Let the questions be: 1)Relative position of the lines r and s 2)distance between the lines r and s, I also will provide the answer for 2 but I don't know how to compute it. \begin{itemize} \item Relative position of the lines r and s: r and s are skew lines r: $\begin{cases} \phi_r= (1, 1, \lambda-2) \\ \theta_r=90^{\circ}, \psi_r=90^{\circ}\end{cases}$ s: $\begin{cases} \phi_s= (\mu, \mu -1, -1 ) \\ \theta_s= \psi_s= 90^{\circ} \end{cases}$ To find the perpendicular direction vector, we take the cross product of the two normal vectors: $\begin{cases}\hat{v}_{r}\times\hat{v}_{s}=(\cos90^{\circ}\hat{r}\times\cos 90^{\circ}\hat{s}= (\lambda-1\hat{i}+1\hat{j}лав-2\hat{k}=(\lambda-1)\hat{i}-2\hat{j}=(\lambda-1)\hat{i}+\hat{j}\end{cases}$ Distance between the lines r and s is the distance between the skew lines, so I have only to find a point on these lines and take the distance from the origin: $P=(\lambda -1$, $\mu -1, -1)$ Now, the distance is $\sqrt{(1-(\lambda -1)^2+1-2^2}=\sqrt{(1+\lambda^2-2\lambda+1)}$ The answer is $\sqrt{\lambda^2+1}$
A.346	A set that has an upper bound but no least upper bound is called a bounded set above. A set that has a lower bound but no greatest lower bound is called an unbounded set below. A set whose every upper bound is also a lower bound is called a closed set. In mathematics, an open set is a set which has a non-empty intersection of its upper and lower bounds. An infinite set is a set with no least upper bound. A set with no greatest lower bound is called an unbounded set. Notice that we have a set of all rational numbers greater than $1$. This set $S$ has no least upper bound because for every $M > 0$, we can always find a rational number $r$ such that $r > M$. Consider the set of all even integers, which is bounded above by $M = 0$. No matter how small we make $M$, we can always find a rational number $r$ such that $r > 0$ and $\frac{r}{2 > M$. However, this set has a greatest lower bound, $0$. To see this, note that given any $l \in \mathbb Q$ such that $l^2 > 2$, then $l - l$ is a positive integer. Since $l$ is a rational number, it can be expressed in the form of $l = \frac{a}{b}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers. Then $l - 1 = \frac{a}{b} - 1$ where $a,b$ are both positive integers. But we can express $l - 1$ in the form $\frac{a}{b}$ as $\frac{l - 1}{b}$, so $l - 1 < 0$. Q.E.D. Therefore, the set of all rational numbers greater than $1$ is a closed set because it has a greatest lower bound of $0$ and an upper bound of $0$. The set $\{r \in \mathbb Q \mid r^2 > 2, r > 0\}$ is unbounded below. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{Because it has no least upper bound}$. The answer is Because it has no least upper bound
A.347	Proof: The proof is basically showing that if the GCD of $a-b$ is 1, then the GCD of $a+b$ and $a-b$ is also 1 or 2. Two equations are given: $a+b = ma$ and $a-b = na$. Subtract the second from the first: $(m-n)d = a-(n+m)a$ $$ \Rightarrow \Rightarrow \frac{a}{d}=1 $$ By the definition of GCD, this shows $d$ divides $a$, so $d$ must be a divisor of $a$. But $d$ is also a divisor of $a-b$, so $d$ must be a divisor of $b$. If $d=1$, we're done. Otherwise, we may divide the original equation of $a+b$ by $d$ to get a dividend of 2, so $a+b = md = 2$, and we're done again. Otherwise we know $a+b = 2$, and the our job is to show $d$ divides both $a-b$ and $b$. Subtract the original second equation from this: $$ (m-2n)d=a-2b $$ Again showing that $d$ divides $a$ and so $d$ divides $b$. Thus we have shown that in both cases, $a+b$ and $a-b$ have a common divisor of 1 or 2. Q.E.D. @DerekHolt answer:It may be useful to add and subtract these equations to see why this works: 1. $a+b = (m+n)d$ so $a+b = md$ 2. $2a = (m+n)d$ and $3b = (m-n)d$, so $3b = (m+n+m-n)d$ $$ \Rightarrow \Rightarrow \frac{a+b}{a-b}=1 $$ 3. $(m-n+m)d$ divides $a-b$ and also divides $a+b$, since $d$ divides $b$. Since we know $d = \gcd(a+b,a

A.349	Below is the text from the last part of my textbook that describes how to do this:Since we know that $x!$ and $y$ are equal, we can group the factors on the right-hand side to obtain: $$y = x\sqrt{2\pi} \cdot\left(\frac{x}{e^x\right)$$ Therefore, $x\sqrt{2\pi} = y\sqrt{e}$ or $x\sqrt{2\pi} = y\sqrt{e} \Rightarrow x = y\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{e}$ Only 114.5 is satisfied by the equation, which means that x = 25.5 or y = $\sqrt{\pi}.$. Since $x!$ is thelaravel in $\sqrt{2\pi x},$ we have $\boxed{25.5! = \sqrt{\pi}$, and indeed, $25! = \sqrt{\pi}$. #### 25
A.350	Then, I'm lost, I don't know how to go about proving that $\frac{(k+1)^3 - (k+1)}{2}$ and $\frac{(k+1)^3 - (k+1)}{3}$ are integers, could someone help. I would appreciate it. Answer:The induction step is proving that if 2 and 3 divide $k^3-k$, then 2 and 3 will divide $(k+1)^3-(k+1)$. We can factor $k^3-k$ as $(k-1)k^2+k$. Now, we need to show that $(k+1)k^2-k$ is divisible by 2 and $(k+1)k^2-k$ is divisible by 3. Since we cannot have a negative term in a natural number, $k^2-k$ is always positive. We are done if we can show that $k^2-k+k$ is divisible by 6, since $k^2-k$ is the difference of two consecutive squares, which is always even. We can factor $k^2-k$ as $k(k-1)$. Thus $k$ must be one greater than an even number, that is, $k(k-1)$ is even. Completing the square on $k-1$, we have $(k-1)/2$, which is an integer. Thus $k$ is odd. The product of two odd numbers is even and therefore, $k^2-k$ is even. So, we can factor out an even number an even minus an odd number, and we have $(k+1)k^2-k = (k)(k-1)$ divisible by 6. So, $(k+1)^3-k$ leaves a remainder of $0$ when divided by 3, which means $k(k-1)$ leaves no remainder when divided by 3. The remainder of $k+1$ is the same as the remainder of $k$. Therefore, $(k+1)^3-(k+1)$ is divisible by 3, as desired. So, the induction step is complete. QED.
A.352	The answer is as follows : Very easy: take a function which is 0 for $x$ from $0$ to $\infty$ and equal to $1$ between $3$ and $4$. E.g. $f(x) = \chi_{[3,4]$ the point mass function, then $-\frac{1}{2}$ for $x$ from $-5$ to $5$. Now multiply this by a test function which is 0 for $x$ from $-1$ to $1$ and $1$ for $x$ from $1$ to $5$. This gives you a function which is 0 for $x$ from $-1$ to $5$, but has a finite positive area. Answer: $\boxed{\frac{1}{2}$
A.353	Let's consider two deck of cards drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards. Let X be the random variable representing the rank of the card drawn (Ace, 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen,King) and Y be the random variable representing the rank of the card drawn (Ace,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,Jack,Queen,King). 2,4,6,7,9,10,Jack,Queen,King are represented by 11 while the King is represented by 0. Now, if both X and Y are independent, then we will have $P(X=Y)= P(X=1)*P(Y=1) + P(X=0)*P(Y=0) = 6/2*3/52 + 1*1/2 =63/52 Now if X and Y are uncorrelated, we will have E[XY] = 0. So, $Cov(X,Y) = E(X)E(Y) = 0. $Cov(X,Y) = E(X)-E(Y) = E(X) - 0 = X - 1/2 $Cov(X,Y) = 0 - 0 = -1/2 $Cov(X,Y) != 0 implies X and Y are dependent. Therefore X and Y are dependent. Say, in a standard deck of 52 cards, we have one Ace of Diamonds (rank 1) and one Ace of Clubs (rank 1). In this case X and Y will be uncorrelated but dependent. Another example could be two dice rolls, where difereing in one die result in even number Indicates the result of the other die is an odd number and vise-versa. Another example, two dices, a 5 in X means the result in Y is 6, an odd number.and a 6 in Y means the result in X is odd. In these cases, X and Y are dependent. Therefore, two independent random variables, X and Y,
A.354	Answer:There is a common misconception in the question. Euclid's element is not the converse of this statement. The correct statement which Euclid's Lemma proves is that if $p$ and $q$ are two positive integers, $p > q$ and $p$ divides $ab$, then $p$ divides $b$. The lemma states: "If $p$ divides $\gcd ab$, then $p$ divides both $a$ and $b$." In other words, given two numbers, the smallest positive divisor of their GCD is always a divisor of each. The key to this problem is to use the definition of a prime number. Since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct primes, they cannot both divide $a$, which means that their GCD must be $1$. So to use Euclid's lemma, we need to find a smallest divisor that divides $a$ and that is $\boxed{1$. Since prime numbers have no positive divisors other than $1$ and $a$ itself, this means that $p_1p_2$ must divide $a$. (A smaller positive number can't divide both $a$ and be a divisor of $p_1$ and $p_2$ since they're prime, so the only possibility is $1$. Or equivalently, both primes must be factors of $a$.). The answer is 1
A.355	We begin by defining $g(x)=xf(x)+y. $g(f(x)) = f(x)^2 + f(y)$. Then by substituting g(f(x)) into g(f(x)) we get $g(f(g(x)) = g(f(x)^2 + f(y)) \Longrightarrow g(f(x)^2 + f(y)) = g(x) \Longrightarrow g(x) = g(f(f(x)+y)$ Now substitute $g(x)$ into the given equation in order to get $g(f(f(g(x)) = g(x) \Longrightarrow f(x) = g(f(f(x)+y) = f(g(x) \Longrightarrow g(x) = x$. Thus there is a solution $f(x) = x$, as desired. Now suppose there is another $h(x)$ such that $f(x) = ax+b$. Let $g(x) =h(x) $ so $g(f(x) = af(x)+b$. Substituting this into the given equation, we get $g(f(x) = a^2(ax+b)+b$. Substituting into $g(f(x) =xf(x)+y$, we get that $a^2x+b = ax+b.\Rightarrow a = 1$. Thus, $a = a = 1$. Not only $g(f(x) = h(x)=f(x)$, but also $g(f(x) = gh(x) = f(x)+y$, so $g(x) =h(x) = f(x)+y$. Then that would mean $f(f(x)=f(x)$. But this cant be true for all $x$. Thus, no other solution. \[\: \] Let me make one last thing clear. If $g(x) =f(x)$ why cant it be true? Set $x = -1$, then $g(-1) = f(-1)$. So we have $g(-1) = f(-1) = f(1)$. But we get $g(-1)=(-1) \ne f(1)$. So only $f$ can
A.356	Answer: By differentiating the given equation $k$ times, we get $k$ times of the given differential equation. So we want a particular solution where $ f^{(k)}(x) = f(x)$. Note that $f^{(k)}(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!}$. Differentiating, we get: $$f^{(k+1)}(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{knx^{kn-n}{(kn)!}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{knx^{kn-n}{(kn-1)!}.$$ Let's define $g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!$, where $k\in\mathbb{N}$. Then $g^{(k)}(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{kn}$ and $g^{(k+1)}(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{knx^{kn-n}{(kn-1)!}$. Thus $f^{(k+1)}(x) = g(x),$ so $f^{(k+1)}(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}x^{kn} = g(x)$. Therefore, the sum in the end needs to be expressed as a sum of the form $g(x)$, where $g(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_nx^{n}$ with $a_n = \frac{(-1)^n}{n!(k-1)!$. Now, $f^{(k+1)}(x)=g(x) \Longrightarrow f^{(k+1)}(x) -g(x)= g^{(k+1)}(x)$, and $f^{(k+1)}(x)= \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!}+\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{kn}}{(kn-1)!}$. If we multiply the second sum on the right by $(kn-1)!$, we get: $$ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{kn}[(knx^{kn-
A.357	There's a couple ways to approach this problem. One way is to use interpolation. We can't guarantee that we can write a unique function that fits the series definition, but let's try to approximate. Since we have two points, we can pretty accurately say that $f(1) = 2$ and $f(2)=4$ and $f(3)=8$. By extending linearly, we find that $f(4)=12$, $f(5)=16$, and $f(6)=18$. So the trend is to add 2, 4. And we get $(f(n)=2n-2)$ for $n\leq 5$. We can keep doing this: 1. $f(n)=2n-2$ for $n \le 5$ 2. $f(n)=4n-4$ for $n \le 6$ 3. $f(n)=8n-8$ for $n \le 7$ 4. $f(n)=10n-10$ for $n \le 8$ etc. This gives us a pretty good idea of how it works. Since we're dealing with a bunch of 2's and 4's, we want uniqueness. We can try the lowest digits of $\pi$ to approximate and see if we can pinpoint it. $\pi(1)=\frac{3.1416$. Since $\frac{3}{9}=\frac{64}{3}$ we can use these two terms to figure out the following: 5. $\pi(2)=\frac{3555.55512$, 6. $\pi(3)=\frac{354.4081$, 7. $\pi(4)=\frac{353.0889$ 8. $\pi(5)=\frac{353.1777$ 9. $\pi(6)=\frac{353.2491$ 10. $\pi(7)=\frac{353.3165$ 111. $\pi(8)=\frac{353.5427$ $\frac{353.576
A.358	We're considering a solid of revolution generated by a function $y(x)$, $x \le x \le a, x \ge 0$. Price a cylinder of radius $r$ and height $y$ as a hollow cylinder. One can partition the solid into disjoint cylinders of radius $r$ (thickness $dx$) and height $y$. Each cylinder is "filled" with a smaller cylinder which has radius $r-2\delta x$, height $y-\delta y$, where $\delta x$ and $\delta y$ can be small and $\delta \le \frac{1}{2}r$. It's a bad shape forlder than the big cylinder by a factor of $\frac{r^2}.$ Thus, it's reasonable to think of $2\pi y$ as the circumference of such hollow cyl([p.9], where $r=y-\delta y$). As the number of cylinders goes to infinity, the area of the larger cylinders goes to zero and that of smaller cylinders goes to $2\pi \cdot \frac{1}{2}= \frac{\pi}{2}$. The result is $\pi ydx$. But we need $\int \pi y\, dx$. What's the problem with this? \[p.9]: radius-height, one of the cylinders on the left has height $y-\frac{1}{2}\delta y$ which can achieved by two small ones of radius $\frac{r}{2},$ or $y-\delta y-\frac{1}{2}\delta y$, and so on. Since the height of the large one is $y$, the total height added (+) 10). [/p]. This isn't a right solution because the number of hollow cylinders goes to infinity. Part of the hollow is, indeed, $2\pi y$ cylinder−10 cylinders.−−10 cylinders The answer is $\boxed{\pi y}$,1010−−1010.
A.359	To solve the integral, we use the substitution $u=\tan\theta$, so $\theta = \arctan(u)$. We also need to make sure that our result will be in terms of a sine function, so we take the conjugate of the denominator and square: $$\cos^2\theta = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{x^2 + 4} \quad \Longrightarrow \quad \sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 4} = \pm \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 4}}$$ Therefore, our answer is $$\int \sin\theta\,d\theta = \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 4}\,d\theta = \int \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 4}\sqrt{4}\,d\theta = \frac{2}{x}\sqrt{\frac{x^2 + 4}\} = \frac{2}{x}\sqrt{x^2}\sqrt{4} = \boxed{2\sqrt{x}$$ (1) Another example is where the Wilhelm composition has to be used. If we made the substituion $u = |x|$ the output would have been $-\sqrt{3}$ for some values of $x$. That is, $u$ and $du$ would have to be taken as the absolute value of $x$. Similarly, if we made $u = -x$, we'd have to take the absolute value of the integral also. But, as stated, we don't take absolute values, including in the case when $u=\tan\theta$. Why not? (2) About the conjugate of denominator: However, we are not always taking the principal angle. If $\tan\theta$ is the principal value, why cannot we take its complement? Because lower-quadrant values are the principal values of cosine and sine? Look at a sinusoidal, say: $$\theta = \frac{\pi}{6, \frac{7\pi}{6}, \frac{111\pi}{6} = 120^{\circ,
A.360	The Fourier transform of a function $f(x)$, denoted by $\mathcal{F}\{f(x)\$, is given by: $$\mathcal{F}\{f(x)\}(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-2\pi ikx} dx$$ For $$f(x) = \frac{1}{\vert x \vert}$$, we have positive and negative values. We can split the integral into two parts: $$\mathcal{F}\{\frac{1}{\vert x \vert\}(k) = \frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-2\pi ikx}}{x} dx + \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{0} \frac{e^{2\pi ikx}}{x}$$ Now, we can use the property of the exponential function that $e^{-ax} = \frac{1}{e^{ax}$: $$\frac{1}{2} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-2\pi ikx}}{x} dx + \frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{0} \frac{e^{2\pi ik}}{x}$$ The second integral is the same as the first, so we only need to calculate the first: $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-2\pi ikx}}{x} dx = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{e^{-2\pi ikx}}{x} dx$$ This has a simple antiderivative: $$-\frac{1}{2\pi ik} e^{-2\pi ikx}\Big|_{0}^{\infty} = -\frac{1}{2ik} \Big( e^{-2\pi ik(0) - e^{-2\pi ik(0)\Big) = -\frac{1}{2ik} (-1) = \frac{1}{2ik}$$ So the Fourier transform of $$\frac{1}{\vert x \vert} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2ik}$$. The answer is \frac{1}{2ik}
A.361	No, $F$ is not always differentiable. Consider $f(t) = t^2 \sin(1/t)$ on $[0,1]$. This function is Riemann-integrable but not differentiable at $t=0$. So, $F$ is not differentiable at $t=0$, but the integral $\int_0^1 t^2 \sin(1/t) dt$ exists, since it equals to $-\frac{1}{3}$. Therefore, the answer is True.
A.362	Answer: Let $C_0$ be a non-empty chain in the poset $P$. We define a sequence of sets $\{X_n\}$ such that: \begin{itemize} \item $X_0 = C_0$ \item $X_1 = C_0 \cup \{x_1\}$ where $x_1 = \ minimum{C_0}$ where $R$ is the relevant linear order \item $X_2 = C_1 \cup \{x_2\}$ where $x_2$ is the least element of $X_1 \setminus C_1$ \item $X_3 = C_2 \cup \{x_3\}$ where $x_3$ is the least element of $X_2 \setminus C_2$ \item $X_n = C_n \cup \{x_n\}$ where $x_n$ is the least element of $X_{n-1} \setminus C_n$ \end{itemize} Stretch of "plain" sets $X_n$: $X_n = C_{n+1} \cup \{x_n\}$ is a chain. If $x_1 \in X_n$, we are done; if not, there exists $x_{n+1} \in X_n$ which is comparable w/ $x_n$. It seems simple to me but I am too sleepy.
A.363	There are two cases to consider: $x > X_0$ and $x \geq X_0$, If $X_0$ is non-positive, we are done since in the first case we have already concluded a contradiction. Now suppose that $X_0 \geq 0$. Then $X_n \downarrow X_0$. For $X_0$ to go to 0, it must be the case that $X_n \geq 0$ for all $n$ and these variables are strictly decreasing to 0. Thus $P[X_n \leq x | \mathcal{F}_0]$ for some $n$. It follows by the reverse inequality that $X^* \geq x$. Then $X^* \geq x$ a.s. from the definition of the supremum. By the subadditivity of the probability measure, it follows that the desired probability is $1$. If $X_0$ is negative, then $X_n \uparrow 0$. For $X_0$ to go to 0, it must be the case that $X_n \leq 0$ for all $n$ and these variables are strictly increasing to 0. Thus $X^* \geq x$. Then $X^* \geq x a.s.$ from the definition of the infimum. By the subadditivity of the probability, it follows that $P[X^* \geq x \geq x | \mathcal{F}_0$. Therefore, the answer is $1 \wedge X_0/x$. Q.E.D.
A.364	If $A$ is the empty set, then $d(x,A) = \infty$. Therefore, the statement is vacuously true. Assume $A$ is not empty, so pick a point $a \in A$. Pick a $b \in A$ with $d(x,a)$ minimal among all such points. Then by definition of $\inf$, we have $$\inf\left\{ d(x,a:\ a\in A\right\} = \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty} d(x,a) = d(y,a) = \inf\left\{ d(y,a:\ a\in A\right)$$. But we can also see that $d(x,a)\leqslant d(x,y) + d(y,a)$ for such a $a$, So the statement is true for that case, too. Thus, $\boxed{\text{Yes}$. The answer is \text{Yes}
A.365	If we define the ordinal interior of a set as the largest ordinal less than or equal to the cardinality of the set, we see that the set of all ordinals less than $\alpha$ which are not in $\alpha$ is just $\alpha$ itself. It follows that there can always be a bijection between a subset of $\alpha$ and a proper subset of $\alpha$. Now consider two concepts $\alpha$ and $\alpha^+$. First notice that since $\alpha$ is "bigger" than $\alpha$, any bijection from $\alpha$ to a proper subset must be improper. Now for every ordinal $\beta < \alpha$, consider the set $\gamma = \beta,\gamma$. Now consider the map $f: \alpha \to \gamma$ which sends $\beta$ to $\gamma$. It must be the case that $\gamma \leq \alpha$. We claim that $\gamma < \alpha$ because if $\gamma \geq \alpha$ then $\gamma$ was extramely large, and if $\gamma \geq \alpha$ then it is impossible to inject into a set of size $\alpha$ since $\alpha$ is the largest ordinal less than or equal to it. Similarly, it must be the case that $\gamma \geq \alpha$ since $\alpha$ was mapped to less than or equal to itself by $f$. Thus $\gamma = \alpha$. But if $\gamma = \alpha$, the function is improper, an obvious bijection exists. If $\gamma < \alpha$, it is the case that $\gamma$ has size less than $\alpha$ and we again have an obvious bijection. Thus we have constructed an injectoin from $\alpha$ to $\alpha^+$. The proof is complete if we show that there exists a bijection between any two infinite subsets of ordinals. Define two subsets $A$ and $B$ of ordinals. Either $A = B$ or $A = B \cup \{ \alpha + 1 \}$ for some $\alpha$. If $\alpha \in A$ we see that $\alpha \in B$ since $\alpha \leq \alpha + 1 < B$ for some $B \nsubseteq \alpha$. If $\alpha \notin A$, then $\alpha + 1 \notin B$. Define a bijection $g: A \to B$, by $g(\alpha)= \alpha + 1$.
A.366	Answer:$\text{Given that a normed space $X$ has a linearly indepenent susbset of $n-$ element}\tag1$ let the subset be $S=\{\sqrt{e_1,e_2,....,\sqrt{e}_n\}$ Define $\sqrt{e_i} \in X' $ by $f_j(\sqrt{e_i}=\delta_{ij}$ where $1\le i\le n$ and $1\le j\le n$ and let $\epsilon$ be an any scalar. Then $\epsilon \sqrt{e_i}\in \ker f$. But $\epsilon \sqrt{e_i}= \sqrt{e_i}$ for all $i$. Hence $\{f(\sqrt{e_1),f(\sqrt{e_2}),f(\sqrt{e_3}),...f(\sqrt{e_n)\}$ is a linearly independent set in $X'$(Since if $\sum_{i=1}^n c_i f(\sqrt{e_i}=0$ then $c_i=\sqrt{e_i}=0$ for all $i$). But $f(e_i)\in \ker f \Rightarrow f(\epsilon \sqrt{e_i})= \epsilon f(\sqrt{e_i}=0$ and hence $f(\sqrt{e_1)+...+ f(\sqrt{e_n}=0. This means that $f(\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{e_i}=\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{e_i}=0$. But $\sum_{i=1}^n \sqrt{e_i}$ is a linear combination of $\{ \sqrt{e_1, \sqrt{e_2},...,\sqrt{e_n\}$, thus it gives the desired result. Q.E.D
A.368	\begin{align*} \sum_{n=x}^\infty\frac1{n^2}&=\sum_{n\leq x}\frac1{n^2}+\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac1{n^2}\\&=\left(\sum_{n=1}^x\frac1{n^2}+\sum_{n=1}^{x-1}\frac{1}{n^2}\right)+\sum_{n=x+1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^2}\\&=\left(\frac{\pi^2}{6}+\sum_{n=1}^{x-1}\frac{1}{n^2}+\sum_{n=x+1}^\infty\frac1{n^2}\right)\\&=\frac{\pi^2}{6}+\mathcal O(x), \end{align*} and the answer is $\boxed{\mathcal O(x)$. The answer is \mathcal{O}(x)
A.369	$$J_n = \int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{\sin{(nx)}}{(1+2^n) \sin{x} \: dx} = \int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{d(-\sin{(nx))}{1+2^n}\: dx = \int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{-\cos{(nx) dx}}{1+2^n} = -\int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{\cos{(nx) dx}}{2^n} = -\int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{d(2^n \cos{(nx)}}{1+2^n} = -\int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{-\sin{(nx) dx}}{1+2^n} = -\int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{\sin{(nx) dx}}{1+2^n} = \boxed{J_n}$$where n is a positive integer. The answer is J_n
A.370	Consider the integral of a function $f: \mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}$ defined as $f(x) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} \chi_{[2^i, 2^{i+1}}(x)$, where $2^i$ and $2^{i+1}$ are integers. This function is a step function. It is not easy to deal with this function in the same manner as before since we cannot directly compute $\int fd\mu = \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} \mu([2^i, 2^{i+1})$. However, it is clear that $\int fd\mu \le \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} \mu([2^i, 2^{i+1}) \to \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} \mu([1,2)$. Therefore, the lower sum can be less than the upper sum and $\int fd\mu < \sum\limits_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^i} \mu([1,2)$. In general, we have $\int fd\mu \le L \le U$, where $L$ is the least upper bound and $U$ is the greatest lower bound. Step functions have many properties that simple functions lack, for example, non-negativity, non-decrease, non-selection, and non-additivity. But a necessary condition for the interchange to be Justifiable is that the function is tight, which means that for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists a step function $s$ such that $d\mu(s) < \epsilon$, meaning that $\int s d\mu < \epsilon$. That is, the set of discontinuities of $f$ is of measure $\frac{\epsilon}{2}$. Thus, if we consider step functions instead, we need a more general answer.
A.371	Please and thank you so much. Answer: The statement you are trying to prove is not correct. Consider the counterexample $f(x) = 1/x$ and $g(x) = 1/x$ on the interval $[0, 1]$. Then $|f(x)g(x)| = 1$ for all $x$ and $||f|| = ||g|| = \infty$. You will have $|f(x)g(x)| < ||f|| \cdot ||g||$ in general. The correct statement would be $|f(x)g(x)| \leq \frac{||f|| \cdot ||g||}{|f(x)||}$. This can be proved by using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We have $|f(x)g(x)| \leq \sqrt{||f|| \cdot ||g|| \cdot \frac{||f|| \cdot ||g||} = \sqrt{||f||^2 \cdot ||g||^2}$. The equality occurs when cosidering the constant functions $f(x) = g(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{||g||}$ on $[0, 1]$. Hence, we have $|f(x)g(x)| = ||fg||$.
A.372	Definition: A ring (or more generally, a commutative ring) is a set equipped with two operations that generalizes the arithmetic operations of addition and multiplication and satisifies the following properties: 1. It has an additive identity (usually denoted 0) and a multiplicative identity (usually denoted 1). 2. It has an additive inverse to each element. 3. It forms a group under addition. 4. It forms a distributive law. 5. It has no zero divisors. (Non-zero) elements have a multiplicative inverse. Now, we want to consider the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}\left[\sqrt{d}\right]$ of a number theoretic variable $\sqrt{d}$. i. Mean-adding or subtracting any integer $n$ numbers yields a multiple of $\sqrt{d}$ and so (adding an even number of them) yields a multiple of $d$. ii. Multiplying with any integer $n$, $0<\sqrt{d}<n$, yields another integer in $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}\left[\sqrt{d}\right]$. iii. Multiplying by an integer $n$, $-\sqrt{d}<n<0$, improves the reduction of $\sqrt{d}$ by $n$. iv. Multiplying by $-\sqrt{d}$ inverts the sign of the result. If $\sqrt{d}$ were negative all of the above hold just as well. To illustrate, let $d=-5$, so $\sqrt{d}=-1$. Then we can take $n=-1$. Then the ring becomes $\mathbb{Z}\left[-\frac{1}{2}\right]$ - the integers of the form $\frac{a-b\cdot \sqrt{5}$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers, with addition defined as usual and with multiplication defined componentwise addition. Consider $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}\left[\sqrt{-5}\right}=\left\{\frac{a-b\sqrt{5}\right|a,b\in\mathbb{Z}\}$. Multiplying by $-1$ we get $\frac{a\sqrt{5}-b$, which is in $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}\left[\sqrt
A.373	Method of Infinite Descent: Suppose $$\sqrt n ={a\over b},$$where $gcd(a,b)=1$ and $a$ and $b$ are integers. $$\sqrt n = {ab\over 1}=ab^{1/2}.$$Then, let $n={a\over b}^2$ so $$\sqrt n={ab\over1}=ab^{1/2}={a^2\over b}.$$Since $a$ and $b$ are integers, and $\sqrt n$ must be rational, then $a^2$ and $b$ must be a pair of integers that multiply to give $\sqrt n.$ Thus they must be a pair of two different perfect squares. Since just one of them is a perfect square, then $\sqrt n$ must be the square root of the other. This is a contradiction because it cannot be expressed as the product of two integers that are both equal to $\sqrt n$. Method of Total Schurcfeldt: If $\sqrt n$ is an integer then $n$ must be a perfect square. If $n$ is a perfect square, then we are done. Otherwise, $\sqrt n$ is a fraction with a reduced denominator that is a perfect square. If we let $$\sqrt n = {a\over b},$$then $n={a^2\over b},$ so $b$ must divide $a$. But $a$ and $b$ generate $\sqrt n$, which implies $b$ divides $\sqrt n$. Applying this again, $b$ must be a divisor of $a$. But $\sqrt n$ generates $a$, which is a contradiction because its gcd is one. We infer that $\sqrt n$ is not an integer. Similarly, if $n$ is an integer, we have a contradiction. The answer is "The method of total Schurcfeldt fails to show that $\sqrt n$ is irrational if $n$ is a perfect square because it implies $\sqrt n$ is an integer."
A.375	Case 2: $n$ is even. If $n = 2k$, then we can write the equation as $x^2 + 6 = 2^k$. Because all the even powers of 2 are of the form $2^1$ multiplied by an even number, we make the substitution $y = x^2$, so \[\xcancelto{2}{x^2} + 7 = 2^n = \cancelto{2}{2^k} \Rightarrow y + 4 = 2^k,\] which gives the followingsystem of congruences: \begin{align*} y + 4 &\equiv 0 \pmod{4} \\ y &\equiv -2 \pmod{2^2. \end{align*} Adding these two congruences tell us \[ y \equiv 2 \pmod{8}, \] so $x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{8}$. Since we made the substitution $y = x^2$, this tells us \[x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{8}.\] Thus there are no solutions when $n$ is even. But what about the case where $n$ is odd? Substituting $x^2$ in for $y$ in the last system of congruences, $x^2 \not\equiv 2 \pmod{8}$ tells us \[\begin{aligned} 0 &\equiv 0 \pmod{4} \Rightarrow x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{4} \\ & \equiv -2 \pmod{2^2 \Rightarrow x^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{8} \end{aligned}\] which implies $x \equiv 0 \pmod{8}$ and $x \equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. Because $(1,2)$ and $(-1,2)$ are both solutions to $x^2 + 7 = 4$ (try them!), $x \equiv 2 \pmod{4}$ tells us there is no solution in $\mod{4}$. Thus there are no solutions when $n$ is odd. Therefore there are only $\boxed{0}$ solutions in $\mod{8}$ and $\boxed{2}$ solution in $\mod{4}$. The answer is 2
A.376	\strong{Limit of the sequence} For all $n$, $1 \leq k \leq n$, $k^2 \leq \sqrt{n} \leq n$, so $\sqrt{k} \leq \sqrt{n} \leq k+1$. Summing over $1 \leq k \leq n$, we have \[ \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}+\cdots +\sqrt{n} \leq \sqrt{1} + \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{3}+\cdots + \sqrt{n} \leq 1+2+\sqrt{3}+\cdots + \sqrt{n}. \]The left hand side is $\sqrt{n (1+1) = \sqrt{n+1}$ and the right hand side is $n+1$, so our desired limit is $\frac{\sqrt{n+1}{n} = \boxed{1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$. Evaluate this limit as $n$ goes to infinity. The answer is 1+\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}
A.378	$\left(-3\right)^\frac{2}{2}$ is not equal to $\sqrt{\left(-3\right)^2}$ because $\sqrt{\left(-3\right)^2}$ is equal to $|-3|$, which is $3$, and $-3^\frac{2}{2}$ is equal to $\frac{3}{2}$ because the square root of a number squared is the number itself. The answer is $\boxed{\frac{3}{2}$. The answer is \frac{3}{2}
A.379	Let S be the set of all isomorphisms from G to itself, with the operation being composition of functions. Let's show (S,*) is a group: \begin{itemizethe properties of a group 1. Closure: for all f,g in S, the composition of f and g is in S. Since f and g are isomorphisms, their compositions fg and gf are also isomorphisms (by properties of isomorphisms). Hence, if f and g are in S, their composition is in S. Thus, S is closed under the operation *. 2. Associativity: For all a,b,c in S, (c o (f g) = (f o g) o b = (c o f) g = (g o f) b, because (c o f) ◦ g = c o (f ◦ g) o b = (g o f) o b. 3. Identity: The identity map is in S, because the identity map is an isomorphism. 4. Inverses: The inverse of a map in S is also in S, because inversion maps are isomorphisms. 5. Orders: Let n = |G| = order of G. Then |S| = n, by the above observations. If f is in S, its inverse f^(-1) is also in S (since it's an isomorphism). Also, if f1 and f2 are in S, then so is (f1f2) and (f2f1), because they are also isomorphisms. The only possibility for f1 and f2 to have an order > 1 is 2, which means they have a cyclic structure: one affected by an element of order 2, and the other affected by an element of order 2. By the Inverse Isomorphism Theorem, they must have the same structure, and hence we have the following possibilities: Case I: Both have a single element of order 2, then there exists an element of order 2 in G: Say, a. Then we have a, a, and aa, and a^(-1) = a^(-1). Case II: One has order 2, and the other order 1: Say, b and b. Then b^(-1) = b
A.380	Let $f$ be defined on $[0,\pi]$. Given $\int^{\pi}_{0}f (t) \sin(t)dt =\int^{\pi}_{0} f (t) \cos(t)dt = 0$, we have $f(x)=0$ admits two solutions in $[0,\pi]$. Proof: Assume that $f$ is positive on $[0,\pi]$ and let $a$ be the smallest such that $f(a)\neq 0$. Since $f$ is continuous on a compact set, it must attain its minimum on $[0,\pi]$. By the Extreme Value Theorem, $f$ attains its maximum at some point in $[0,\pi]$, say $x_0$, where $f(x_0)>0$. Then by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists $t_0 \in [0,\pi]$ such that $\frac{f(x)-f(0)}{f(x_0)}=\frac{\sin t_0}{\cos t_0}$. Again by continuity of $f$, $f(0)=0$. It follows that $f$ is $0$ on the interval $[\frac{\pi}{2}-t_0,\frac{\pi}{2}]$. If $x_1$ is a root of $f$, then $f(x_1)=0$ and $f(x_1)=\sin x_1$. By the intermediate value theorem $f(x_1)=f(\frac{\pi}{2})=0$. This contradicts the fact that $f(x_1)\neq 0$. The answer is $\boxed{\text{Two}$. The answer is \text{Two}
A.381	Define $g$ as follows: Let $g(k)$ be the ordered tuple $(g(k)_1, g(k)_2, ..., g(k)_n)$, where $g(k)_i = fi(k)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. Now, if we define $g(k)$ for $k \leq |A_1|$, then $g: \mathbb{N}$ bijects with $A_1 \times ... \times A_n$. If not, then let $k = |A_1|+1$. If $k > |A_1|$, define $g(k)$ to be the first element of $A_2$ The ordered tuple $(g(k)_1, g(k)_2, ..., g(k)_n)$ is the same as the ordered tuple $(g(k-|A_1|, g(k-|A_1|, ..., g(k)_n))$; if $k \leq |A_1|+|A_2|$, then $g(k)_i = fi(k-|A_1|)$ for $1 \leq i \leq n$. Generally, $g(k)_i = fi(k-|A_1|+...+A_{i-1}$. Extend this idea to $g$ to cover all of $A$. This can be done since each $A_i$ is countable. Furthermore, since each $A_i$ has the same cardinality as $\mathbb{N}$, $A$ is counted by $|A_1| \times |A_2| \times ... \times |A_n| = |A_1|...|A_n|$. Hence, $A$ is countable. The answer is A bijection exists since $g: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A$ is a bijection.
A.382	A function $v: SS \to \{ \mathbf{T}, \mathbf{F} $ is determined by the pairs $(n_1, T_n), (n_2, F_n), (n_3, T_n), \ldots$. Define a new function $v_m : SS \to \{ \mathbf{T}, \mathbf{F} $ by $v_m (A_1) = T_{m}, v_m(A_2) = F_{m}, v_m(A_3) = T_{m-1}, \ldots$ so that $v_m(A_n) = \mathbf{F}_m$ for all $n \leq m.$ It can be shown that $v_m$ is a distinct function from $SS$ to $\{ \mathbf{T}, \mathbf{F} $ for all $m.$ We can create a sequence of functions $v_1, v_2, v_3, \ldots$ that is not in the range of any function from $SS$ to $\{ \mathbf{T}, \mathbf{F} $ Note that $v_m$ can be seen as the diagonal of $(m, T_m)$ in the table. It follows that there is no bijection between $V$ and $SS$, hence $V$ is uncountable. Therefore, the answer is correct, and the approach is reasonable.
A.383	Let $z=x+iy$, with $x,y$ real numbers. Then we have that $|f_a(z) = \left|\frac{x+iy-a-a\overline{z}\right| = \left|\frac{x-a}{1-\overline{a}z\right| \le \frac{|z-a|}{|1-\overline{z}a|}$. Now, use the triangle inequality to obtain: \[\left|\frac{x-a}{1-\overline{a}z\right|^2\le \left|\frac{x-a\overline{z}}{|1-\overline{z}| \cdot \frac{1-\overline{a}z| \le \frac{|z-a|^2}{|1-\overline{z}|.\]Then $|z-a|^2 \le \frac{|z-a|^2}{|z-a|^2$. Taking square root, $|z-a|\le 1$, and we are done by the
A.384	I have no idea what that means, but I guess it's related to combinations. I know that combinations are formed by multiplying n! and then dividing by r!(n-r)!, but what's the use of the vertical line there? Is that a fraction? I've never seen a fraction with a denominator of a variable before. If someone could help explain it in simple terms, I'd appreciate it BTW, here's the link to the problem set: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-006/index.html P.S: Here, n! means factorial of n Answer: It's a combination. The vertical line represents a fraction. f_3(n) = n(n-1)(n-2)/3! So, f_3(5) = 5!/(3!) = 5*4*3 / 3! = 5*4 = 10 f_3(3) = 3!/(3!) = 3*2*1/3! = 3*2 = 6 f_3(6) = 6!/(3!)=6*5*4*3*2/3!=6∗5∗4∗3∗2=30
A.385	Thoughts:First let's understand Euclidean domain. A domain is said to be Euclidean if it satisfies division algorithm, that is, for any a non-zero element a in the domain there exist a and b such that $$a=qb+r_{1}+r_{2}\text{ and }r_{1},r_{2}\notin \{0\}$$Then we can write $$a=bq_{1}+r_{1}+r_{2}\text{ and }r_{1}\notin \{0\}$$and also $r_{1}\leq a\sigma(b)$Every time we multiply the last two equations we will get b=\lambda a+\mu r_{1} from where a=b\sigma(a)+\sigma(b)i.e. The sign function $\sigma$ is a Euclidean function.We can generalize this to any linear equation. If a and b are linearly independent over a field, say F, then size of product ab is the least common multiple of the sizes of a and b. That is, size of ab=lcm of $\sigma(a), \sigma(b)$if $\sigma$ is a Euclidean function. Now consider two polynomials f and g of degrees $m,n$ respectively.We know that $*(a,b)_{1}=lcm(\sigma(a),\sigma(b)$. If $m>n$, then $f_{1}*g_{1}\geq \sigma(f)>\sigma(g)$and hence $f(x)>g(x)$ for all x in the domain. So f divides g. It is a well-known result in ring theory that a domain where every linear equation has a unique solution for a given equations is called a Euclidean domain. So the answer is yes:): It is true in general and it can be proven as above. Note: The same is true for any linearly ordered rings in which exist a Euclidean function like |a|. Answer is: Yes
A.387	The answer is $1+4=5$.
A.388	A unique solution occurs when 2linear eqn 1 -2linear eqn 2 = 0 -> solving this yields $x_1 = 2, x_2 = (k-5), x_3 = 1$. Thus, k = 3. For this choice, there are infinitely many solutions. So the correct answer is c.
A.389	(-) Convergence of a series with a finite number of terms The series $\sum_{i=1}^\infty \frac{1}{i}$ is a fruitful topic in mathematics, and many mathematicians have worked with this and related problems. Suppose we have a sum of the form $\sum_{i=1}^N a_i x^i$, where $x$ is a positive number and $a_i$ is a sequence of positive numbers which is decreasing and converges to $0$ as $i$ goes to infinity. Good questions to ask: 1. What must happen to the sum if we replace $x$ with $-x$? Does it converge (to what)? 2. What if $N$ is very large? Joseph Merrick's answer: a.) The word "convergence" has different meanings in different contexts of mathematics, but in most cases, if a series of the form $\sum_{i=1}^\infty x^i$ is convergent, then its sum is less than or equal to a certain constant. b.) It can be shown that the given series $\sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{i}$ is a special case of a more general class of series called a geometric series. A geometric series with first term $1$ and common ratio $r$. It is well-known that geometric series converge if $|r| < 1$. However, if $N$ is very large, the term $r^{N+1}$ dominates the sum and the convergence depends on its behavior. If $r$ is positive, then the series converges if $|r| < 1$. If $r$ is negative, the series does not converge. Plugging in $x = -r$, we get $\sum_{i=1}^\infty (-1)^i r^i$, which doesn't have a simple closed form, but we can analyze its convergence by considering the tail of the series $\sum_{i=N+1}^\infty r^i$. This series is the Maclaurin series expansion of $\ln(1+r)$, and if $|r| < 1$, then it converges. Also, we know $\lim_{i\to\infty} r^i = 0$, so our series converges if $-rN$ is negative. That is, if $r$ is
A.391	The answer is given as:$$\left\| X \right\|_r = \left\| X \right\|_1 + \left\| Y \right\|_1 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{r} \right)^{r - 1} \leq \left( \left\| X \right\|_1 + \left\| Y \right\|_1 \right)^r = \left\| X+Y \right\|_r,$$which uses the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in reverse. The proof of the reverse inequality is almost the same and replaces $\left\| \cdot \right\|_r$ with $\left\| \cdot \right\|_1$. The only slick way to do this is to use Jensen's inequality, which states that for a non-negative real number $r$ and a function $f$ such that $f(t) = t^{r}$, $f \left(\frac{a+b\right) \leq f(a) + f(b)$, for all $a,b \geq 0$. Rewriting this inequality in our notation gives: $$r \left\| X+Y \right\|_1 \leq \left\langle X \right\|_1 \left( r \left\| Y \right\|_1 \right) = \left\| X \right\|_r + \left\| Y \right\|_r,$$which completes the induction step. Thus, the proof of the inequality follows by mathematical induction: $$\left\| X \right\|_1 \leq \left\| X \right\|_1 1 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{r} \right)^{r - 1} \leq \left\| X+Y \right\|_r.$$Taking $r = \frac{1}{r}$ and using the given conditions, we get the desired result. The rest of the answer is the base case: $$\left\| X \right\|_1 = \left\| X \right\|_r = \left\| X \right\|_1 + \left\| Y \right\|_1 \left( 1 + \frac{1}{1} \right)^{r - 1} \leq \left\| X \right\|_1 + \left\| Y \right$$for $
A.394	Definition: A function is continuous at $x = a$ if for every sequence $(x_n)$ that converges to $a$, the sequence of its images $f(x_n)$ converges to $f(a)$. Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence of irrationals converging to $x$. Then $x_n = \frac{m_n}{n_n$ and $f(x_n) = \frac{1{m_n}$, for some integers $m_n$ and $n_n$. Case 1: Given $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \ge N, n_n > |m_n$ and there exists a positive integer $K$ such that $k \ge n_n$ and $m_k, n_k \ge k$. Thus $0 < 1/k < \epsilon$. Case 2: Given $\epsilon > 0$ there exists $N$ such that for all $n \ge N$, $m_n - k|m_n| < \delta$ for some integer $k.$ Then there exists $n_k$ with $1/k \le \epsilon$. I think both cases are fine, but I need to showcase. Case 1: $x_n = \frac{m_n}{n_n$ As $n_n \ge |m_n$, $\left|\dfrac{m_n - \dfrac{m}{n}\right| \le \dfrac{1}{n_n}$ So given $\epsilon > 0$, we have $\left|\dfrac{1}{n_n}\right| < \dfrac{1}{K} \le \dfrac{\epsilon}{1}$, that is, $\delta \le \dfrac{1}{K}$ by choice. Case 2: $x_n = \dfrac{p_n}{q_n$, where $q_n > 0$ We have $\left|\dfrac{p_n}{q_n}\right| \le \dfrac{1}{q_n}$ so $|\dfrac{p}{q}|\le \dfrac{1}{q_n}.$ Given $\epsilon > 0$, we have $\left|\dfrac{1}{q
A.399	Every pair of disjoint axis-aligned rectangles in $A$ is a "fence-closed" rectangle. Fence-closed rectangles can be formed by taking rectangles which have at least one side parallel to the coordinate axes. That is, a rectangle with vertices at $(x,y_1), (x,y_2), (x_2,y), (x_2,y_1), (x_3,y_2), \ldots , (x_n,y), (x_{n+1},y_1), \ldots , (x_{n+1},y_{2}), \ldots , (x_{n+1},y_{n-1}, (x_{n},y_{n-1})$ for some $n\geq 1$ and some $y_i < y_{i-1}, y_i < y_{i+1}$. Consider two fence-closed rectangles $R_1$ and $R_2$. If their intersection is nonempty, then by the intermediate value theorem, there exists a point in $R_1 \cap R_2$ that belongs to both rectangles, which cannot be the case since they are disjoint. Thus, $R_1 \cap R_2 = \emptyset$ and so $A$ is a union of fence-closed rectangles, which implies that it is a countable set. Q.E.D. To generalize: If we have a family of $N$ rectangles for which there is no point in $A$ that belongs to both of them, then for each rectangle in $A$, there contains a $1 \times 1$ rectangle containing it which is not in the family. This can be rephrased as: there exists a $k \times 1$ rectangle not containing any rectangle with side parallel to one of the given family of rectangles, for some $k \geq 1$. Proof: Suppose there is a point in our rectangle, say $(x, y)$, which does not belong to a rectangle in our family. Consider the nearest $k$ rectangles above/below/left/right of $(x,y)$, with $k$ choices for each coordinate. For one coordinate, it can be arbitrary between $a_1, d_1$, for another between $a_2
A.400	The question tells us that there are only two factorials being multiplied: $10 \times 9 =10\times9 = 90$, $110 \times 8 =10\times 8$. We don't need to calculate a square of a fraction, because of cancellation. We are dividing by $10\times9=90$ and $10 \times 8 = 80$, For the first case, we were dividing by $2^{n-2}$ because we have two factors of two, the first having a $2^4$ and second having $2^3$, and for the second case, we were dividing by $2^{n-4}$ because there are two factors of two, the first having $2^2$ and the second having $2^1$. In general, in the first case, we have one factor of four and in the second case, we have only one factor of two. Dividing by $2^{n-4} = \frac{1}{2^{n-3}$ and $\frac{1}{2^{n-2)}$ gives $\boxed{\frac{1}{8}}$ The answer is $\frac{1}{8}$
