A.301	 Here, $\|A\|_1$ is the 1-norm of a matrix, which is the maximum sum of the absolute values of the entries of $A$, $\|A\|_2$ is the 2-norm of a matrix which is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue, and $\|A\|_\infty$ is the $\infty$-norm of a matrix, which is the maximum absolute value of any element of $A$. For a matrix with real entries, these are equivalent norms. In other words, all of them are equivalent as norms on the set of $m \times n$ matrices. Answer: The inequality $\|A\|_2\leq\sqrt{m}\|A\|_{\infty}$ follows from the fact that the (column) sums of $A$ are bounded by $\sqrt{m}$ in absolute value. The inequality $\|A\|_1\leq\sqrt{n}\|A\|_{\infty}$ follows from the fact that the (row) sums of $A$ are bounded by $\sqrt{n}$ in absolute value. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives $$ \left(\sum_{i,j}\lvert a_{ij}^2\rvert\right)^{1/2}\left(\sum_{i,j}\lvert b_{ij}^2\rvert\right)^{1/2}\leq\left(\sum_{i,j}\lvert a_{ij}b_{ij}\rvert\right)^{1/2}, $$ so \[ \left(A^TA\right)^{1/2}=\left(\sum_{i,j}\lvert a_{ij}^2\rvert\right)^{1/2}\leq\left(\sum_{i,j}\lvert a_{ij}\left(A^TA\right)_{ij}\rvert\right)^{1/2}=\|A\|_1\|A\|_{\infty}. \] Then $\|A\|_2=\sqrt{\rho(A^TA)}\leq\|A\|_1\|A\|_{\infty}$.</s>

A.303	" Lie algebra of dimension 2: A bilinear map satisfying the conditions $a)$ and $b)$ is a Lie algebra if $[x,y] = -\frac{1}{2}[y,x]$ for all $x,y$ in the vector space. Answer: First, it's important to note that the Lie bracket is not unique - it can be any function $[x, y] : V \times V \rightarrow V$ satisfying these conditions, and indeed we can see that there are Lie algebras of dimension 2 with bracket other than $[x, y] = x$, for example the set of transformations of an interval under the operation of translation by $x$, $(y \mapsto y + x)$. In this case, $[x, y] = x$. It might be easier to think of a Lie algebra as a vector space with a ""Lie bracket"" operation, as opposed to an ""inner product"", which satisfies the conditions $[x, y] = x$ and $[y, x] = -x$. If we denote the operation by ""."" and write $x \cdot y$ instead of $[x, y]$, then the conditions are $x \cdot x = 0$ and $x \cdot y + y \cdot x + y \cdot x = 0$ for all $x, y$. The bracket operation is not unique, but it's obvious that if we have such an operation, then it must be of the form $x \cdot y = x$ (since the sum of two translations is a translation by the sum of the vectors), and $y \cdot x = -x$ (by the condition $x \cdot y + y \cdot x + y \cdot x = 0$). We can thus define a Lie algebra structure on any vector space by simply using the identity map, and this will satisfy the conditions. Thus, there are exactly as many Lie algebras of dimension 2 as there are vector spaces of dimension 2 up to isomorphism. For your last question, by a ""passage"", I assume you're referring to the remark on page 60 of Hall's \em{Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations} that ""it is well known that the number of Lie algebras of dimension 2 is exactly 2"".

Springer, Berlin, 1975. [ZBL0389.580006](https://zbmath.org/?q=an:0389.580006). Comment: To be a bit more specific about what the questioner is asking, it might be helpful to state that a *quasi-complex structure* on a real surface $S$ is a complex curve $J$ on $S$ such that for every $p\in S$, $T_pS = \ker(dJ_p)$, where $dJ_p$ is the derivative of $J$ at $p$. Comment: @JohnHughes: There's a good chance that's a bit over my head. But I'll try to give it a shot. A complex curve $J$ is a map from $S$ to $\mathbb{C}$ that is $1$-dimensional, i.e. $J(S) \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. And at every point $p$, the tangent vector $dJ_p$ is a linear map $\mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. So for each $p$, $dJ_p$ is an isometry of $\mathbb{R}^2$ to a line in $\mathbb{R}^2$. This gives $T_pS = \ker(dJ_p)$, which must be a $1$-dimensional complex subspace of $\mathbb{R}^2$, i.e., a line. But a real surface has $2$-dimensional tangent space, and a complex curve on a real surface can't have a $1$-dimensional complex subspace as its tangent space. So there can't be a quasi-complex structure. QED? Answer: In a nutshell, a tangent vector of a complex curve $J$ on a real surface $S$ has to be orthogonal to $J$ itself. But a real surface does not have complex tangent spaces, since those are subspaces of $\
A.305	 In the infinite series $\sum_{r=1}^N \frac{1}{2^r}$, the general term $a_r=\frac{1}{2^r}$. Thus, by the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, the sum is $\frac{a}{1-r}$. The floor of this is $\left\lfloor\frac{a}{1-r}\right\rfloor$, which would be $1$ for $r<1$ and $0$ for $r\geq 1$. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{1}$. Note: The floor function $\lfloor x \rfloor$ is the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. For example, $\lfloor 3.4 \rfloor = 3$ and $\lfloor -1.7 \rfloor = -2$. Comment: The floor function of the sum is $1$. The limit of the floor function is $1$. Comment: I'm sorry, but I still don't get it. The floor function of an infinite geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ is $a/(1-r)$. If $r<1$, then the floor of the sum is $1$, but if $r\geq 1$, the floor of the sum is $0$. How can the limit of the floor function be $1$ if it has different possible values depending on $r$? Comment: The limit as $N \to \infty$ of $\lfloor \frac{1}{2^r} \rfloor$ is $0$ for all $r \geq 1$, and $1$ for $r < 1$. So the limit as $N \to \infty$ of $\lfloor \sum_{r=1}^N \frac{1}{2^r} \rfloor$ is $1$. Comment: The floor function is not defined for infinite series, therefore it's not clear what you're asking.

A.306	 $B$ is Euler mascheroni constant, $\gamma$ is Euler's constant and $\log$ is natural logarithm to the base 10. For more details on Mertens theorem, read the wiki article. The calculation for the Euler-Mascheroni constant from the Prime Number Theorem is based on an assumption that $\log(1 - 1/p)$ is a rational number for each prime $p$. However, this is not necessarily the case. For example, $\log(1 - 1/2) = \log(1/2) = -\log(2)$ which is an imaginary number (since $1/2$ is not a positive real number). Although the sum of these terms converges to a real number, it does not necessarily follow from the Prime Number Theorem that the Euler-Mascheroni constant is a real number. In fact, it is known that for a prime $p$, $\log(1 - 1/p)$ is irrational. So, if the Euler-Mascheroni constant is defined as the limit of the sum, it must be irrational as well. There is a theorem of Hurwitz that shows that $\gamma$ (Euler's constant) is irrational. So, we can conclude that the Euler-Mascheroni constant is also irrational. If we know that $\log(1 - 1/p)$ is irrational for each prime $p$, and the sum converges, then the Euler-Mascheroni constant is also irrational. However, the calculation for the Euler-Mascheroni constant from the Prime Number Theorem does not provide a formal proof that $\log(1 - 1/p)$ is always irrational for each prime $p$. This is an unproven assumption. Hence, it is not considered as a proof of irrationality. To formalize the proof, we should use the techniques of analytic number theory to show that $\log(1 - 1/p)$ is irrational for each prime $p$. This can be done by using the fact that $\log(1 - 1/p)$ is a continuous function that takes on only irrational values for positive integers $p$. Alternatively, one can use the fact that if
A.307	 This seems obvious from the definition, but I don't know how to express it in mathematical language... The Carmichael function gives the order of an element in a multiplicative group. If the elements are all coprime to $n$, then every element has order equal to $\varphi(n)$. If $n$ is not a prime power, there will be elements of order strictly less than $\varphi(n)$, and the Carmichael function will return the largest such order. For prime powers, every element of the group has order equal to the prime power, and the Carmichael function returns the smallest such order. To find an element of order $\lambda(n)$, we can start from the prime factorization of $n$, and for each prime $p$ that divides $n$, find the largest $p^i$ such that $p^i \equiv 1 \pmod n$. The Carmichael function returns the product of these exponents.</s>

A.309	 Also, if $p\equiv 2 (\text{mod }3)$, then $p=2+3n$ for some integer $n$. If we rewrite $x^3=a$ as $x^2*x=a$, we see that the equation has no solutions for $a\neq 0$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$, because $a$ would be a cube and thus would have a multiple of $3$ for its coefficients. But for $a=0$, there is a single solution, which is $0$. So, we have the equation $x^3=0$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$, and it has exactly one solution, $0$. Right? For the previous reasons, if $p$ is a prime number such that $p\equiv 2 (\text{mod }3)$, then the equation $x^3=1$ over $\mathbb{F}_p$ has only one solution, $1$. Is this correct? I'm asking these because the book that I'm reading does not prove these facts and I'm trying to solidify these basics. Answer: The equation $x^3 = a$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$ has exactly one solution for each $a \in \mathbb{F}_p$ if and only if $p \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$. This follows directly from Fermat's Little theorem, which says that if $a \in \mathbb{F}_p$ and $a^{p-1} = 1$ then $a$ is a root of the equation $x^p = 1$ (for $p$ a prime number). But $x^3 = a$ is just the equation $x^p = a$ for $p = 3$. Note that Fermat's little theorem is a corollary of Euler's theorem, which says that if $a$ is a primitive root of $\mathbb{F}_p$, then $a^{p-1} = 1$ (this time without any conditions on $p$). The equation $x^3 = 1$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$ has exactly one solution, $1$, if and only if $p \equiv 1 \pmod{3}$, because in this case $
A.310	 The passage goes like this: Given the equation $\frac{4}{x} + \frac{10}{y} = 1$, we can multiply each side by the common denominator $xy$ to get $4x + 10y = xy$. Rearrange it to $4x = y$. This implies $x = y$ or $x = 2y$. Since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, $x$ must be $2$ or $1$. But $x = 2y$ implies $y = 1.$ Thus, the solution is $x = 2, y = 1$. I can't seem to find the error in my logic. Am I missing something? I apologize for the confusion, I'm just a beginner. Comment: You're missing the fact that $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, so $x$ can't be equal to $2y$ Comment: One problem is that $\frac{4}{x} + \frac{10}{y} = 1$ does not imply $4x = y$. Answer: Since the equation involves both fractions, we should solve it as a fraction equation. From the given equation, we can simplify it to $\frac{4}{x} - \frac{6}{y} = \frac{6}{4}$. Multiply both sides by $4y$ to get $4x - 6 = 6y$. Simplifying, we get $4y = 6y$, which implies $y = 1$. So, $x = 2y$ or $x = 3y$. But since $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, $x = 3y$ is not possible. Hence, $x = 2y$. So, $y = 1$, $x = 2$. Answer: If $x$ and $y$ are positive integers, then $x = 2y$ or $x = 3y$ are not possible. Hence, $x = y = 1$ is the only solution. Alternatively, you can multiply both sides of the equation by $xy$ to get $4x + 10y = xy$, which simplifies to $4x

Answer: I assume that you mean $\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor = \frac{a}{b} - \frac{\frac{a}{b} \pmod 1}$ for all $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$. Then for each integer $a$, $\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor$ is equal to $a/b$ for $b \le a < b+1$ and $\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor = a/b - 1$ for $b+1 \le b < a$ If $a \le c \le b+1$, then $\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor = a/b$, so $\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor a/b \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor$. If $b+1 \le a < c$, then $\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor = a/b - 1$, so $\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor a/b \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor - \frac{1}{c}$. I'll leave the details to you.</s>
A.313	 $\textbf{Remark}$ The proof from the hints is not correct. In an abelian group, if $a$ and $b$ commute, then $(ab)^n=a^nb^n=1$, so $|ab|$ must be a divisor of both $r$ and $s$, which implies $\gcd(r,s)=\gcd(a,b)=1$, so $a$ and $b$ are of coprime orders, and therefore, $|a||b|=|ab|$. But we are asked to prove $|ab|=rs$, where $r$ and $s$ are the orders of $a$ and $b$ respectively. So, $|ab|$ must be the product of $r$ and $s$. The result is true in any group, not just abelian groups. In an abelian group, if $a$ and $b$ do not commute, then $(ab)^n=a^nb^n$ need not be $1$, and the claim $|ab|=rs$ is not necessarily true. For example, in $S_3$, the order of each element is $2$, but we do not have $2\times{2}=3$, so $|ab|=3$ is not true. Comment: In fact, the correct statement is $\gcd(|a||b|,|ab|) = 1$ for all $a,b \in G$ (this is only true in an abelian group), so in this case it would be $|ab| = rs$ as $rs = |a||b|$ (since $\gcd(r,s) = 1$). Answer: If $G$ is an abelian group, then for all $a,b \in G$, $(ab)^n = a^n b^n$ for all $n$. So if $|a| = r$ and $|b| = s$, then $|ab| = |a|^n |b|^n = rs$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and in particular, $|ab| = rs$ when $n = 1$. If $G$ is not abelian, then the result is not necessarily true. For example, in $S_3$, the order of each element is $2$, but $2 \times
A.314	 The context for this problem is on page 4 of [1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.09710). The statement is that if $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \|e_n-x_n\| < 1$ and $x_n$ is a sequence of vectors in a Hilbert space, then the closed span of $\{x_n\}$ is the whole space. The answer to this problem depends on the specifics of the vectors $x_n$ and the specific Hilbert space, but if we assume that $x_n$ are the standard basis vectors then the vectors are mutually orthogonal and the condition $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \|e_n-x_n\| < 1$ implies that $\|\sum_{n=1}^\infty x_n\|^2 < \infty$. For the sum of squares to converge, the terms $x_n$ must be square summable, which implies that the space is finite-dimensional. Hence, the closed span of $x_n$ is the whole space, which is Hilbert. If the sum of squares does not converge, then the sequence $x_n$ is not square summable, and the closed span of $x_n$ is not the whole space. However, we can still have the closed span of $x_n$ be a dense subspace of the Hilbert space (for example, see (3.3) in [1]). In this case, the condition $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \|e_n-x_n\| < 1$ might be used to show that the closed span of $x_n$ is still dense in the Hilbert space (for example, show that the sequences $e_n$ and $x_n$ are simultaneously weakly Cauchy). Comment: I assume $\|e_n - x_n\|$ denotes the distance between the vectors $e_n$ and $x_n$ in the Hilbert space, if it's not stated explicitly. In this case, the condition $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \|e_n - x_n\| < 1$ implies that all $x_n$ are contained in the unit ball of the Hilbert space, which means that the

A.316	 If it is not, would you point me to the correct direction? The correct answer will be that multiplicative group of any finite field is a product of cyclic groups, and in this case each factor has order 2 (and hence, the corresponding group of units has order 1). But for a more general $n$, we need to use the properties of the prime factorization of $2^m$ to make a guess. Edit: I forgot to generalize the prime factorization part, which is $\prod_{i=1}^{\operatorname{ord}(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})} 2^{\operatorname{ord}(\mathbb{Z}/p_i^{2^{i-1}\mathbb{Z})}$, where $p_i$ are the prime factors of $n$. But I still don't see why they have to be powers of two... Answer: By definition, the group of units of $\mathbf{Z}/2^m\mathbf{Z}$ is the set of all integers of the form $a$ such that $a \cdot b \equiv 1 \mod 2^m$ for some integer $b$. Now, write $a = 2^r \cdot b$, with $r \in \{0, \dotsc, m-1\}$ and $b$ odd. Then $a \cdot b \equiv 1 \mod 2^m$ if and only if $2^r \cdot b \equiv 1 \mod 2^m$, which happens if and only if $r = 0$ and $b$ is odd. Hence, the group of units is $\mathbf{Z}/2^m \mathbf{Z}$, and it is a singleton for $m \ge 1$. For $m = 0$, the group of units of $\mathbf{Z}/2^0\mathbf{Z}$ is empty. Note: the condition $a \cdot b \equiv 1 \mod 2^m$ is equivalent to $a \cdot b = 1$ in $\mathbf{Z}/2^m \mathbf{Z}$, hence $(a, b) \in \mathbf{Z}/2^m \mathbf{Z} \times \mathbf{Z}/2^m \mathbf{Z}$ is a group of order $2^m
A.317	 My idea is: Assume that $n$ is odd. Then, we can write $\frac{1}{(x^2+1)^n}$ as $\frac{1}{2^{n-1}(x^2+1)^{n-1}(x-1)^{n-1}(x+1)^{n-1}$. Then by the substitution $x=\tan(u)$ we get $\int \frac{1}{2^{n-1} \tan^{n-1}(u) \sec^2(u)}$. As $u$ varies from $0$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\sec^2(u)$ varies from 1 to $\sqrt{2}$, so the integral becomes $\int \frac{1}{2^{n-1} \tan^{n-1} \cdot 1}$ which is equal to $\frac{1}{2^{n-1} \int \tan^{n-1} du$. As $\int \tan^{n-1} du$ is a linear function, it equals $u^{n-1} + C$ for some constant $C$. Hence,the integral is $\frac{1}{2^{n-1} (x^{n-1} \arctan(x) + C)$. Assume $n$ is even. Then, we can write $\frac{1}{(x^2+1)^n}$ as $\frac{1}{2^{n-2}(x^2+1)^{n-2}(x-1)^{n-2}(x+1)^{n-2}$. By the substitution $x=\tan(u)$, we get $\int \frac{1}{2^{n-2} \tan^{n-2}(u) \sec^2(u)}$. As $u$ varies from $0$ to $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\sec^2(u)$ varies from 1 to $\sqrt{2}$, so the integral becomes $\int \frac{1}{2^{n-2} \tan^{n-2} du$. As $\int \tan^{n-2} du$ is a linear function, it equals $\frac{u^{n-2} + C$ for some constant $C$. Hence, the integral is $\frac{1}{2^{n-2} (x^{

Since $X$ is a subset of $\Bbb{R}$, it must be uncountable, and therefore has a countable subset $Y$, which is a subset of $X$.

A.322	 In this section, I am going to provide an explanation for the potential formula for $c_n$ and show how to derive it from first principles. Let's start with the triangle number sequence defined by $a_n=\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$. The sum of the first $n$ terms of this sequence is given by the formula $\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}$ for the sum of the first $n$ triangle numbers. In order to find the sum of the first $n$ sums of this sequence (which is essentially the sum of the first $n$ triangle numbers), we can consider the triangle number sequence again, but this time we replace $n$ with $k$ and sum from $1$ to $n$ instead of $1$ to $k$. This gives us the formula for $b_n=\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}$. The sum of the first $n$ sums of this sequence (which is essentially the sum of the first $n$ triangle numbers) is therefore given by $\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)(n+3)}{24}$.</s>
A.324	 As mentioned in problem, the series is $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2 +m^2}. $$ Notice that for each positive integer n, the series $\sum_{m=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2 + m^2}$ is a geometric series with first term $\frac{1}{2n}$ and common ratio $\frac{1}{2n}$, and therefore, by the theorem of geometric series, its sum is $\frac{1}{2n} \times \frac{1}{1 - \frac{1}{2n}} = \frac{1}{2n-1}$. Thus, the series $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2n-1}$ is absolutely convergent and its sum is $\log{2}$, independent of m. Therefore, the original series is absolutely convergent and its sum is $\log{2}$, but it is not conditionally convergent, as the partial sums do not go to zero as n goes to infinity. Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_convergence#Absolute_convergence_and_conditional_convergence and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Formulas for the formula of geometric series sum. The same series can be written as $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2n}\log{\left(\frac{2n}{2n-1}\right)}$. For n large enough, $\log{\left(\frac{2n}{2n-1}\right)} \approx 1$ and the series is then $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2n}$, which is harmonic series and thus diverges. For a more rigorous proof that this series does not converge conditionally, one can use the Cauchy-Hadamard theorem or the integral test to show that the series is not absolutely convergent. For more specific details, please refer to the wikipedia links. Also, if the series is rewritten as $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{2n}\log{\left(\frac{2n}{2n-1}\right)}$, one can use the integral
A.325	 Answer: The first $n!+1$ numbers are always consecutive composite for $n>=2$. This is because $n!$ is always divisible by $2,3,4,5,6$ for $n>=5$. So, for $n>=5$, $n!+2, n!+3, ...n!+n$ are all divisible by $2,3,4,5,6$, and hence, all are composite. Answer: You know that $n!+k$ is divisible by $k$ for all $k=2,3,...,n$ if $n\geq 5$. So, for $n\geq 5$, $n!+2, n!+3, ..., n!+n$ are all composite. And these are the first $n$ numbers after $n!+1$, which is the first composite number after $n!$. So, $n!+1, n!+2, ..., n!+n$ are also consecutive composite for $n\geq 5$. Therefore, for $n\geq 5$, you can generate $n$ consecutive composite numbers by taking $n!+1, n!+2, ..., n!+n$. For $n=4$, we can manually check that $4!+2, 4!+3, 4!+4$ are all composite. For $n=3$, we can manually check that $3!+2, 3!+3$ are composite (since $3!+4=24$ is divisible by $2$ and $3$). For $n=2$, $2!+2$ is the only composite number, so we can't generate any more consecutive composite numbers. For $n=1$, $1!+1$ is the only positive integer, so we can't generate any consecutive composite numbers. For $n=0$, there are no positive integers, so we can't generate any consecutive composite numbers. So, the smallest $n$ for which we can generate 100 consecutive composite numbers is $5$. $5!+1, 5!+2, ..., 5!+5$ gives us 10 consecutive composite numbers. But note that this doesn
A.326	" \begin{blockquote} Since every module is a homomorphic image of a free module, every projective module is a direct summand of free module. To see this, let $P$ be a projective module. As $P$ is a homomorphic image of a free module, there exists a surjective homomorphism $f$ from a free module to $P$. Since $f$ is surjective, $P$ is a direct summand of the domain of $f$, which is a free module, and so $P$ is a direct summand of a free module. \end{blockquote} So, what's wrong in this reasoning? Answer: The phrase ""every module is a homomorphic image of a free module"" means that every module $M$ has a surjection from a free module to $M$, not that every projective module $P$ has a homomorphism from a free module to $P$. In particular, it doesn't mean that every projective module $P$ is a direct summand of a free module, because not every projective module $P$ is the domain of a homormorphism from a free module. It's true that every projective module is a direct summand of a free module, but the proof doesn't use the fact that every module is a homomorphic image of a free module. Instead, it uses another theorem: if $P$ is a projective module and $\phi : F \to P$ is a surjection from a free module $F$ to $P$, then $P$ is a direct summand of $F$. The point of the above theorem is that, if $P$ is a projective module, then any homomorphism from a free module $F$ to $P$ must be surjective, since $P$ is a direct summand of a free module (by the surjection theorem), and a homomorphism from a free module $F$ to $P$ is always surjective (by definition of free module). So, $P$ is a homomorphic image of a free module. But this doesn't mean that every projective module is a direct summand of a free module. For example, if $F$ is a free module, then $F$ is the direct summand of $F \oplus F$ ("

A.329	 Here is the passage: \begin{blockquote} If $(X, \mathcal T)$ is a regular space and $A \subseteq X$ is a compact set, it is well known that for any $p \in A$ and any neighborhood $U$ of $p$, there is a neighborhood $V$ of $p$ such that $\overline{V} \subseteq U$. Apply this to $p \in A$ and $U = A \cup \{p\}$ to find an open set $V$ such that $A \subseteq V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq A \cup \{p\}$. Then we see that for each point $p \in A$, there is an open set $V_p$ such that $p \in V_p \subseteq \overline{V_p} \subseteq A \cup \{p\}$, and $\cup V_p$ is an open cover of $A$. Apply compactness to find a finite subcover $V_1, ..., V_n$ of $A$. Set $V = \cap_1^n V_i$ to be the intersection of these sets. Then $A \subseteq V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq A \cup \{p\}$ as required. \end{blockquote} Answer: This is an immediate corollary of the theorem: \begin{blockquote} In a $T_1$-space $(X, \mathcal T)$, for each $p \in X$ and each neighborhood $U$ of $p$, there is a neighborhood $V$ of $p$ such that $\overline{V} \subseteq U$. \end{blockquote} So, for each $a \in A$, and for the neighborhood $U = A \cup \{a\}$, there is a neighborhood $V$ of $a$ such that $\overline{V} \subseteq U$.

A.337	 Answer: If all normal lines of a curve are parallel, then the curve lies on a line. To see this, consider a curve $\gamma : \>{\mathbb R}\to{\mathbb R}^2$, and fix a point $p$ on it. For any other point $q$ on the curve, the line $\overline{pq}$ is a normal line at $q$, and by hypothesis all such lines are parallel. It follows that $\gamma(t)$ lies on the line through $p$ and $q$ for all $t$, and since this line is parallel to $\gamma$, $\gamma$ lies on a line through $p$ and $q$. As $q$ was arbitrary, $\gamma$ lies on a line through $p$.</s>

A.339	 Comment: In your post, you assume that $a$ and $b$ are integers and $a\mid bc$ for some other integer $c$, but in the title you say $a$ and $b$ are prime. This gives a contradiction. If $a$ and $b$ are not prime, then $a\mid bc$ for some $c$ does not imply $a\mid c$. For example, $6\mid 12$ but $6$ does not divide $12$. Comment: If $a$ and $b$ are *not* relatively prime, then we can find a common factor $d$ such that $a = dk$ and $b = d\ell$. Then $dc = ab = k\ell$, so $dc$ and $k\ell$ are both (positive) divisors of $c$, but $dc$ and $k\ell$ are not both divisors of $c$. Therefore, $dc \ge c$. Answer: This is not true. If $a = 6$ and $b = 12$, then $a \mid bc$ for $c = 18$ but $a$ does not divide $c$. In fact, for any $a \ne \pm 1$, we have $a \mid bc$ for $b = \pm 1$ and $c = \pm a$, but $a$ does not divide $c$. If $a$ and $b$ are (positive) prime, then by Euclid's lemma, $a \mid bc$ implies $a \mid b$ or $a \mid c$. If $a$ and $b$ are not prime, then $a \mid bc$ does not necessarily imply $a \mid b$ or $a \mid c$. You might be thinking of GCD, which states that if $a$ and $b$ are not relatively prime, then $gcd(a, b) \mid c$ for any integer $c$. This is true, but not equivalent to saying that $a \mid bc$. Comment: If $a$ and $b$ are not relatively prime, then they have a common factor, namely $d = \gcd(a, b)$,
A.340	 Answer: For all $n \in \mathbb{N}$, $|x_{n+1} - x_n| < \frac{1}{3^n}$ implies $|x_n - x_m| < \frac{1}{3^n}$ (for all $m \leq n$). Thus, the sequence is Cauchy. This is a direct consequence of the triangle inequality: $|a - b| = |a - c + c - b| \leq |a - c| + |c - b|$. In this case, $a = x_{n+1}$, $b = x_n$ and $c = x_{m}$. Notice that $m \leq n$ implies $c = x_{m} \leq x_{n+1}$ so $|c - b| = |x_{m} - x_n| \leq |x_{n+1} - x_n| < \frac{1}{3^n}$. Hence, $|a - b| = |x_{n+1} - x_n| < \frac{1}{3^n} + \frac{1}{3^n} = \frac{2}{3^n}$. Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary. Take $n_0 = \lceil \frac{\log{\epsilon}}{\log{2}}$. Then, for all $n \geq n_0$, $|x_n - x_{n+1}| < \epsilon$. Hence, the sequence $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence.</s>

In the case of $\mathcal{A} = \{a\}$, this is clearly not possible, as $\{a\}$ is not a topology on $X$ (it does not contain the empty set or $X$). For a subbasis to form a topology, it must contain the entire set $X$ (as the intersection of all sets in the basis is $X$). Hence, no, $\mathcal{A} = \{a\}$ is not a subbasis for a topology on $X$. Comment: @A.P. I guess I'm confused as to the nature of the theorem. I thought a subbasis for a set $X$ was a collection of subsets of $X$ that can form a basis for a topology. Now in this case, $\mathcal{A}$ is a subset of $X$, and $\mathcal{A}$ forms a topology on $X$. This isn't possible? The theorem says that any collection of subsets of $X$ forms a subbasis for a unique topology on $X$. But we can't form a basis with one element? What am I missing? Comment: The theorem does not say that ""any collection of subsets of $X$ forms a subbasis for a unique topology on $X$"". The theorem states that for any collection of subsets of $X$, if this collection forms a subbasis for some topology, then it is the unique subbasis for that topology. The collection $\mathcal{A} = \{a\}$ does not form a subbasis for any topology, because it does not contain the empty set or $X$, and hence it is not a subbasis. The subbasis for a topology must contain all subsets of $X$, and in this case, it does not. Answer: The statement is:"
A.345	 I would be very happy for some help in this. Answer: The direction vector of the line $r$ is $(1,1,1)$, and the direction vector of line $s$ is $(1,-1,1)$. Their cross product is a vector perpendicular to both of them, and it's $\pmatrix{1\\ 1\\ -2}$. The scalar triple product of these two direction vectors is zero, so these lines are parallel. This means any point on $r$ is a skewing point, and any point on $s$ is also a skewing point. The midpoint of $r$ and $s$ will be a point on the line orthogonal to both lines, and it's $(1,\frac{1}{2},0)$. The distance between $r$ and $s$ is the length of the vector from the midpoint to either of them.</s>
A.346	 \begin{blockquote} Sets in $\mathbb Q$ may not have a greatest lower bound. For example, the set of all rational numbers $r$ such that $r^2 > 2$ does not have a greatest lower bound, because for any $r$ such that $r^2 > 2$, we can find a smaller $r$ such that $r^2 > 2$. Therefore, there is no $r$ that is both a lower bound for the set and a greatest lower bound for the set. If a set has no greatest lower bound, it is not bounded below. The set of all rational numbers $r$ such that $r^2 > 2$ is an example of a set that is not bounded below. Another example of a set that is not bounded below is the set of all positive rational numbers. The set of all rational numbers $r$ such that $r > 0$, which is the same as the set of all nonnegative rational numbers, is also not bounded below. On the other hand, every set of integers has a greatest lower bound, namely the smallest integer in the set. For example, the set of all integers $n$ such that $n > 2$ has a greatest lower bound of $3$. The set of all integers $n$ such that $n > 0$ has a greatest lower bound of $1$, and the set of all integers $n$ has a greatest lower bound of $-\infty$. \end{blockquote} Answer: $0$ isn't a lower bound for the set in the sense that if $r_1, r_2, ...$ is a sequence of rational numbers in the set, then for any real number $s$, $s$ is a lower bound for the set if and only if $s < \min(r_1, r_2, ...)$. But $0$ is not a lower bound for the set in the sense that the set is not bounded below. One way to show the set is not bounded below is to show that for any $r \in \mathbb{Q}$, $r < \sqrt{2}$, and $\sqrt{2}$ is a lower bound for the set but not in the set. Comment: I didn't quite understand the second sentence. Why does sqrt(2) not belong to the set?
A.347	 Comment: I'm not sure I understand the question. Since $\gcd(a, b) = 1$, we have $a = d$ and $b = d$ for some integer $d$. Then $\gcd(a + b, a - b) = \gcd(2d, 2d) = 2 \gcd(d, d) = 2$. But $\gcd(a + b, a - b) = 1$ or $2$ always, regardless of the value of $d$, so the statement is true. Answer: I'm not sure I understand the question completely. If $\gcd(a, b) = 1$ then $a$ and $b$ are coprime, which means that for any integers $m$ and $n$, $ma + nb = 1$ for some $m$ and $n$. Let $m = n + 1$, then $a + b = (n+1)d = 1$ and $a - b = nd$. Then $\gcd(a + b, a - b) = \gcd(1, nd) = 1$. If $n = 1$, then $\gcd(a + b, a - b) = \gcd(1, d) = 1$, otherwise $\gcd(a + b, a - b) = \gcd(2d, d) = 2$. I'm not sure what do you mean by 'why do we have to add and subtract thesetwo equations'. The equations $a + b = md$ and $a - b = nd$ are not added or subtracted, they are used to find the values of $\gcd(a + b, a - b)$. Comment: I'm sorry for the confusion. I updated the question.

A.349	 I don't think it's possible to solve this equation directly, but we can note that $\log(y) = \log(\sqrt{2\pi x} * (\frac{x}{e})^x)$ and rewrite it using properties of logarithms to get $\log(y) = \log(\sqrt{2\pi x) + x \log(\frac{x}{e}) - x$. From this we can see that $y = e^{x \log(\frac{x}{e}) + \log(2 \pi x) - x}$. Now, $x = e^{x \log(\frac{x}{e}) + \log(2 \pi x) - x}$ and we can rewrite it as $x = e^{x \log(\frac{x}{e})} + \log(2 \pi x) - x$. This looks like the definition of the derivative of $x^{x+1}$, which is $x^{x+1} = e^{x \log(x) + \log(2 \pi x) - x}$. Solving this equation we get $x^{x+1} = e^{x} \cdot 2 \pi x$ that can be rewritten as $x^x = e^{x} \cdot 2 \pi$. But $x^x$ is the definition of $\Gamma(x+1)$. So, the inverse function to $y = \Gamma(x+1)$ would be $\Gamma(y) = x$.I guess it's not possible to find a simple analytical expression for the inverse, but we can solve this equation numerically quite easily. I'm assuming $x$ is a positive integer or a real number. For a real number, I'd just use `scipy.special.gamma` and inverse function `scipy.special.gammaincinv` in python, as they are available in scipy and will give accurate results. For an integer, the value of $\Gamma(x+1)$ is $x!$, which can be calculated using `math.factorial` in python, and is equal to $y$, giving us $x = \Gamma^{-1}(y)$.</s>
A.350	 Answer: In general, if you have a statement $P(x)$ that holds for all natural numbers and want to show it holds for all natural numbers by induction, you need to show two things: \begin{itemize} \item $P(0)$ holds (because the base case is $x=0$) \item If $P(x)$ is true for some natural number $x$, then $P(x+1)$ also holds (because the induction step proves that all natural numbers following $x$ share the property with $P(x)$) \end{itemize} In this case, we want to show that $2$ and $3$ divide $x^3-x$ for all $x$, which means we need to show that $x^3-x$ is divisible by $2$ and $3$ for all natural numbers $x$. The base case ($P(0)$) is easily verified, because $0^3-0=0/2=0/3=0$. For the induction step, we need to show that if $2$ and $3$ divide $k^3-k$ for some natural number $k$, then they also divide $(k+1)^3-(k+1)$. This amounts to showing that $(k+1)^3-k$ is divisible by $2$ and $3$, which is equivalent to $k^3+3k^2+3k+1$ being divisible by $2$ and $3$. But $k^3+3k^2+3k+1 = (k+1)^3-k$, so if $2$ and $3$ divide $k^3-k$, they also divide $(k+1)^3-(k+1)$. This completes the induction step. Note: We didn't have to actually calculate any divisions or moduli for this problem, which makes it much easier, but in more complex problems you might need to make sure that $k^3+3k^2+3k+1$ is indeed divisible by $2$ and $3$ using properties of divisibility or modular arithmetic.</s>

A.353	 The last question also is asking for a real world example to clarify the concept of correlation and independence in two random variables. \begin{blockquote} A random variable, X, is uncorrelated with a random variable,Y, if the covariance of X and Y is zero. That is, $cov(x,y) = E(xy) - E(x)E(y) = 0$.Uncorrelated variables have a zero covariance, but this does not imply independence. For example, two variables that are uncorrelated may still be dependent. This happens when one variable is a function of the other, as in the case where Y = X^2. In this case, E(XY) = E(X^3), so the covariance of X and Y is nonzero, but X and Y are not independent. Another example is when the variables are independent but not identically distributed, as in the case of X and Y being standard normal random variables. The covariance of X and Y is zero, but X and Y are not independent. \end{blockquote} Answer: I am assuming your variables are continuous random variables. So, by definition, two variables $X$ and $Y$ are independent if $f_{X,Y}(x,y)=f_X(x)f_Y(y)$ for all $(x,y)$ pairs. They are uncorrelated if $\text{cov}(X,Y)=E(X.Y)-E(X)E(Y)=0$ or $\text{cov}(X,Y)=0$ which implies $E(X.Y)=E(X)E(Y)$. Thus, uncorrelated $\Rightarrow$ independent $\boxed{False}$. Let's take a simple example to see it in action: Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are independent but not identically distributed then $\text{cov}(X,Y)=E(X.Y)-E(X)E(Y)=0$ for all $x,y$) but $X$ and $Y$ are not independent as $f_{X,Y}(x,y)=f_X(x)f_Y(y)$ is not true for all pairs of $x$ and $y$.

A.354	 Answer: \strong{Hint}. Assume that $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct primes, and let $a$ be a positive integer. If $p_1$ and $p_2$ divide $a$, then by properties of prime numbers, $a = p_1^k * p_2^m$ for some integers $k$ and $m$. Since $p_1$ and $p_2$ are distinct primes, $k$ and $m$ must be at least 1. If $k = m = 1$, then $p_1p_2$ divides $a$. If $k > 1$ and $m = 1$, then $p_1^2$ divides $a$. If $k = 1$ and $m > 1$, then $p_2^2$ divides $a$. If $k > 1$ and $m > 1$, then $p_1p_2$ divides $a$. This covers all possible cases, so $p_1p_2$ divides $a$ as claimed. Note: This is a more general proof than what you are asked for, but the other cases are trivial.

A.355	" Please help. Comment: There's a difference between ""obvious"" and ""trivial."" The solution $f(x)=x$ is not ""obvious"" as we may not be able to spot it easily. It is, however, ""trivial"" as it is the only solution to the functional equation. There are many non-trivial solutions to this functional equation, which can be found by making a careful analysis of the equation. But in this case, $f(x)=x$ is the only one that satisfies the equation and can be proved using standard techniques of functional equations. Answer: For any two functions $f,g$ we have \[f(f(x)^2 + f(y)) = xf(x) + y\] \[g(f(x)^2 + f(y)) = xg(x) + y\] Subtracting these two equations we get \[g(f(x)^2 + f(y)) - f(f(x)^2 + f(y)) = g(x) - f(x)\] \[g(f(x)) = f(x)\] Since $f$ and $g$ are arbitrary functions, $f = g$. Hence, $f(x) = x$ is the only solution. \strong{Note:} The above reasoning is correct under the assumption that $f(x) = x$ is a solution. We can't just say that $f(x) = x$ is obvious without proving it, though.</s>"
A.356	" Any help would be appreciated. Comment: I would suggest looking up ""Jacobi's Triple Angle Formula"" and ""Bessel functions"" to evaluate this series. You will not find a simple formula for the sum, but the Bessel functions are closely related to the solution of the differential equation $f'(x)=f(x)$ and the triple angle formula gives a way to express the solution in terms of exponentials and trigonometric functions. Answer: This is not an answer, but a long comment. Unfortunately, it is known that there is no simple formula for $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!}$. This is known as the Jacobi's Triple Angle Formula and it's a special function, which describes the function $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!}$. There is a close relationship between this and the Bessel functions. As you probably know, the solution to the ODE $f'(x) = f(x)$ is $f(x) = Ae^x$, where $A$ is any constant. However, for $f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!}$, $A$ is a bit tricky to find. We know that $f(0) = 1$ by the formula for the constant term in a Taylor series, so $A = 1$. Thus, $f(x) = \frac{1}{k!}e^x$. The Jacobi's Triple Angle Formula gives us a way to express the constant $A$ in terms of the roots of the equation $f(x) = \frac{1}{k!}e^x$ as $\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{k}\right)$, assuming $k$ is an integer. For the case where $k$ is not an integer, we can use a trigonometric formula (like the Weierstrass formula) to express $A$ in terms of roots. However, this is more complex and requires a lot of background theory. We can find the roots of the equation $f(x) = \frac{1}{k!}e^x$ using the ODE $f'(x)"
A.357	 \begin{blockquote} In mathematics, a function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of outputs. Given a sequence of n numbers, say a1, a2, ..., an, we can define a function f : N -> R as follows: f(n) = an for n = 1, 2, ..., n. Then, for any real number r, if n is the smallest integer such that an = r, we say f(r) = r. If no such n exists, we say f(r) = 0. For example, if the sequence is (3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5, 8, ...) and r = 1.5, f(r) = 4 (since 4 is the fifth number in the sequence). If r = 2.9, f(r) = 0 (since no number in the sequence is equal to 2.9). \end{blockquote} Answer: I believe there are an infinite number of functions, and a rather straightforward way to generate them. Given a finite set of numbers $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$, for each $a_i$ we can construct the function $f_i(n) = a_i$ if $n = i$, and $f_i(n) = 0$ otherwise. This function satisfies $f_i(1) = a_1$, $f_i(2) = a_2$, ..., $f_i(n) = a_n$ for all $n \in \{1, 2, ..., i\}$. The set of all possible functions is then $\{f_i : i \in \{1, 2, ..., n\}$. Each of these functions can be expressed as a piecewise function, e.g. $f_1(n) = \begin{cases} 2 & n = 1 \\ 0 & n \neq 1 \end{cases}$. Unfortunately, the set of all possible piecewise functions is also infinite, but it's a subset of the set of all possible functions. If we exclude piecewise functions, there are an infinite number of
A.358	 I apologize for the confusion, the formula for the area of a surface of revolution is actually $\int 2\pi y \, ds$ where $ds$ is the arc length perpendicular to the axis of revolution (which for a polar curve is $dx$). Thus the formula is similar to the one for the volume of revolution, which is $\int \pi r^2 \, dx$, but here the area of each cylinder is $2\pi y \, dx$ (as $r = y$ and $h = dx$). So it's a different approach, but the basic idea is the same: we use cylindrical shells to find the area of a surface of revolution. The volume of a solid of revolution is $\int \pi r^2 h \, dx$, where $r$ is the radius of each cylinder and $h$ is its height (in this case, $h = dx$). Since the radius of each cylinder is $y$, and the height is $dx$, the volume is $\int \pi y^2 dx$. This integral is equal to $\frac{1}{3}\pi r^3$, so in this case $r = 1$. So for the area, instead of considering each cylinder a solid (volume), we consider it as a surface (area), hence the integral becomes $\int 2\pi y \, dx$, which is what we have. Comment: Your confusion arises from the fact that the radius of each cylinder varies with $x$, while in the case of volume the radius is constant. In the volume integral, $r=1$, so the integral is a simple one-dimensional integral. In the surface integral, $r$ varies with $x$, so the integral is a two-dimensional integral. Comment: The volume integral is a one-dimensional integral because the radius of each cylinder is $1$ (it's a circle), and the height is $dx$. The volume integral is $\int \pi r^2 \, dx$, which is equal to $\frac{1}{3}\pi r^3$, so $r = 1$. The surface integral is a two-dimensional integral because $r$ varies with $x$, so the integral is $\int 2\pi y \, dx$, where $y$ is the radius and $dx$ is the

Am I missing something? Answer: The answer to the second question is no. There is no such rule. However, what is going on is that when you do a trigonometric substitution, the new variable $x$ will be in the first quadrant. So $\tan \theta$ will be positive, and hence, $\sin \theta$ will be positive. Therefore, when you do the inverse, you will get an angle in the first quadrant, which is the principal angle.

A.360	 The function $f(x) = \frac{1}{\vert x \vert}$ is not in the Schwartz space, therefore it does not have a Fourier transform. But one can still define a tempered distribution $u$ such that $u(\varphi) = \int f(x) \varphi(x) dx$ for every $\varphi \in C_0^{\infty}$. The function $f(x) = \frac{1}{\vert x \vert}$ is not in the Schwartz space because it is not in $L^1(\mathbb{R})$ (the function is not even measurable because it is not bounded), but it is a tempered distribution, which is a generalization of the concept of a function to include functions that are not in $L^1$ but are still well-behaved. One way to define a tempered distribution $u$ is by providing its action on test functions: for every Schwartz function $\varphi \in C_0^{\infty}$, $u(\varphi) = \int f(x) \varphi(x) dx$. This is a well-defined integral because $f(x) \varphi(x)$ is a Schwartz function for all $x \neq 0$, and the integral converges absolutely when integrated over a compact set. How do we define $u(\varphi)$ for $x = 0$? The answer is that it depends on the choice of $\varphi$. If $\varphi$ has support contained in $(-1, 1)$, then $u(\varphi) = \int_{-\infty}^{-1} f(x) \varphi(x) dx + \int_{-1}^1 f(x) \varphi(x) dx + \int_1^{\infty} f(x) \varphi(x) dx = 0 + \int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{x} \varphi(x) dx + 0 = \int_{-1}^1 \frac{1}{x} \varphi(x) dx$. But what if $\varphi$ has support contained in $(-1, 1)$ and is also equal to $1$ at $0$? Then $u(\varphi) = \int_{-\infty}^{-1} f(x) \varphi(x) dx + \int_{-1}^1 f(x) \varphi(x) dx +

A.362	Hence, by Kuratowski's Lemma, the partial order has a maximal chain and we are done. Comment: The axiom of choice is **not** equivalent to Kuratowski's lemma. In fact, it is **stronger** than Kuratowski's lemma.The axiom of choice states that for every *set* of disjoint non-empty sets, there is a set that contains exactly one element from each set. The statement of Kuratowski's lemma involves partial orders, not sets. Answer: As Asaf mentions in a comment, the Axiom of Choice and Kuratowski's Lemma are not equivalent. The Axiom of Choice is a global statement about sets, while Kuratowski's Lemma is a local statement about partial orders. While they share similarities, they are not equivalent and it's not clear how to use the Axiom of Choice to prove Kuratowski's Lemma. Kuratowski's Lemma follows from the Zorn's Lemma, which is a much more powerful theorem than the Axiom of Choice. A proof of Kuratowski's Lemma (and many other interesting problems in partial order theory) can be found in Maurice Hajnal's \em{Theory of Partial Orders}, §15.4. The main idea of the proof is to use the fact that every partial order is a transitive subset of some linear order, and then use Zorn's Lemma on the collection of chains in the partial order. A chain is a subset $C$ of the partial order such that for any $a, b \in C$, either $a < b$ or $b < a$. This is a well-ordering, so by Zorn's Lemma, there is a maximal chain.

A.363	 The problem is from [Casella and Berger's](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/97803872918697) book page 275 and I've tried to use the following theorem: If $X$ is a non-negative martingale and $A \in \mathcal{F}_n$ then $E[1_A X] = E[X;1_A]$. Here we have $A={X^* \geq x}$ which is not in $\mathcal{F}_0$ so I don't know how to proceed. I would appreciate any help. Answer: If $x < X_0$, then $X_n$ is bounded above by $X_0$ for all $n \geq 1$, and therefore $X_n$ converges to $X_0$ in probability. By the [Doob martingale convergence theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doob%27s_martingale_convergence_theorem), for all $x$, $X_n$ converges to $X_0$ in $L^1$, and therefore, for all $x$, $X_n$ converges to $X_0$ in probability as $n \rightarrow \infty$. Since $X_0$ is a constant, this implies that $P[X_n \geq x] \rightarrow 1$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$, and therefore, $P[X_n \geq x | \mathcal{F}_0] \rightarrow 1$ as $n \rightarrow \infty$. In other words, $P[X_n \geq x | \mathcal{F}_0] = 1$ for all $n \geq 1$, and therefore, $P[X_n \geq x | \mathcal{F}_0] = 1$ for all $n$. Hence, $P[X^* \geq x | \mathcal{F}_0] = P[X_0 \geq x | \mathcal{F}_0] = \frac{X_0}{x}$.

A.366	 From the fact the $S$ is linearly independent in $X$, we know that $c_1e_1 + \cdots + c_ne_n = 0$ implies $c_1 = \cdots = c_n = 0$.

We want to show that $a_1 = \cdots = a_n = 0$. If $a_i \neq 0$, then by linearity of the functionals, we can find a $c_i$ such that $f_i(c_1e_1 + \cdots + c_ne_n) = a_i \neq 0$. But this would imply that the vector $c_1e_1 + \cdots + c_ne_n$ is not in the span of $e_1, \ldots, e_n$, which is a contradiction.

A.373	 For the first part, show that $\sqrt {15}$ is not rational using the method of infinite descent. You will need to use the prime factorisation of 15 = 3*5. The prime factorisation of 15 gives us 3*5 = 15. If 15 is a perfect square then it must be of the form k^2 for some integer k. But 3 and 5 are both prime and hence, if 15 is a perfect square, then either 3 or 5 must be a square. But 3^2 = 9 and 5^2 = 25, which are both greater than 15, so 15 cannot be a perfect square. Hence, 15 is not a perfect square and sqrt(15) is not rational. For the second part, show that the method of infinite descent does not work for perfect squares. To show this, we will consider the number 9 which is a perfect square (9 = 3^2). We will assume that sqrt(9) is rational and find a contradiction. Let sqrt(9) = a/b where a and b are coprime integers. Since sqrt(9) is rational, a and b must each be a square, i.e., a = k^2 and b = l^2 for some integers k, l. Then 9 = (k/l)^2, and since k and l are coprime, k and l must be of the form 2^a * 5^b. Square both sides to get 9 = (2^a * 5^b)^2 = 4^a * 25^b = 2^{2a} * 5^{2b} = 2^{2a + 2b} * 5^b. Equating the exponents, we see that 2a + 2b = 1, and since a and b are positive integers, the only solution is a = b = 1. Then 9 = 2^2 * 5^1 = 20, which is a contradiction. Hence, sqrt(9) is not rational. So, the method of infinite descent doesn't work for perfect squares, but it does work
A.375	 If n is an even integer, then 2^n = (2^2)^(n/2) = 2^(2*n/2) = 4^n/2, so x^2 = 4^n - 7. We can rewrite this as x = 4^n/2 - 1/2. If n is odd, then 2^n = (2^2)^(n/2) = 2^n, so x^2 = 2^n - 7 = 2^n - 2^0 = 2^(n-1) - 2^0 = 2^n - 1. Notice that this is the same as the equation x^2 = 4^n/2 - 1/2, but with x = 2^n - 1. So, we need to find the integer solutions to both equations. For x = 4^n/2 - 1/2, we know n must be even because x is an integer. For x = 2^n - 1, we know n must be odd because x is an integer. If x = 4^n/2 - 1/2, then n must be either 2 or 4 (since n must be even and 4 is the smallest such number). For n = 2, x = 4^2 - 1/2 = 15 - 1/2 = 14.5. For n = 4, x = 4^4 - 1/2 = 16 - 1/2 = 15.5. Neither of these are integers, so these are not valid solutions. However, for x = 2^n - 1, n can be any odd number. n can be 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., which gives us solutions x = 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., which are all integers. So, the only integer solutions are for n = 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ..., and x = 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... I'm not sure how to generalize this

If $|S| = 2$, then $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are both the only possible compositions, and every element $x$ has $f^{-1}(x) = x$, so the group is abelian and every element has order 2.

A.383	 Let $f_a(z)=\frac{z-a}{1-\overline{a}z}$. We want to show that for all $|a|<1$, $f_a$ maps the unit disk into itself. Since the unit disk is $|z| \leq 1$, we have $|f_a(z)| \leq |z-a|/|1- \overline{a}z|$. If $|a|<1$, then $|1- \overline{a}z| \geq 1-|a|^2$. Thus, $|f_a(z)| \leq |z-a|/(1-|a|^2) \leq 1$ for all $|z| \leq 1$, and $f_a$ maps the unit disk into itself. (I am not sure where the triangle inequality comes into play here? Could someone please provide a detailed explanation?).</s>
A.384	" ""So, for example, the function $f_3(n)$ is the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{2}$. This means that $f_3$ is a function that takes in a single argument $n$, and outputs the value of the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{2}$."" \em{I am not sure what exactly this function means, and how it works. I am not sure how to read it correctly, and I couldn't find any resources online that would be able to teach me how to read this. If possible, could someone please translate this into a more standard mathematical function definition so that I can understand how it works? Thank you!} Comment: There's not much to it, really. ""f3"" is a function that takes in a single argument ""n"" and outputs the binomial coefficient ""n choose 2"" (which is $\binom{n}{2}$). So the function $f_3$ is $\binom{n}{2}$. There's no trickery or anything, it's just a simple function notation. Comment: @DanielV Thank you! But could you possibly write up a proper definition for how this function would work? For example, would it be f(n) = n choose 2, or f(n) = (n-1 choose 2) + (n choose 1) or something else? Answer: This is just the standard way to say that $f_3$ is a function that takes a single argument $n$ and returns the value of the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{2}$. The function $f_3$ is $\binom{n}{2}$. There's no trickery or anything, it's just a simple function notation. In a mathematical context, if $f : X \to Y$ is a function, then $f(x)$ is the value of $f$ at $x$, and if we want to write this using the notation $\binom{n}{2}$, we would write $f_3(n) = \binom{n}{2}$. Thus, the function $f_3$ is simply the function that takes in a single argument $n$ and returns the value $\binom{n}{2}$.</s>"
A.385	 Answer: No. In a Euclidean domain, $\sigma$ gives a measure of magnitude, but it does not have to be additive. However, if the domain is a principal ideal domain, then $\sigma(a) = \#\{p \in R \mid a \in p\}$ (the number of prime factors of $a$), and the statement makes sense. In a Euclidean domain (in the sense of [this wikipedia definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_domain#Definition), i.e., a domain where the Euclidean algorithm works), $\sigma$ is not necessarily additive. However, it still can be measured in terms of the degree of a polynomial, as in the case of polynomial rings. Then the statement is true.</s>
A.387	 Answer: The idea of the proof is correct, but it would be better to make it more formally. I assume you know that for any real numbers $a$ and $b$, if $a \geq b$ then $a$ can be written as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$. For the purposes of this problem, we can show this by induction. If $a < b$, then we can write $a = kb + r$ for some real number $k$ and $r$, where $r < b$. Since $a$ is an integer, $r$ must also be an integer and $k = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor$, the largest integer less than or equal to $\frac{a}{b}$. If $r = 0$, we are done. If $r > 0$, then $\frac{a}{b} = k + \frac{r}{b} < k + 1$, so we can write $a = kb + r = (k+1)b - b + r$. By the induction hypothesis, $a = (k+1)b - b + r$ can also be written as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$, so $a$ can be written as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$. If $a > b$, we can write $a = kb + r$ for some real number $k$ and $r$, where $r > 0$. Since $a$ is an integer, $r$ must also be an integer and $k = \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor$, the largest integer less than or equal to $\frac{a}{b}$. If $r = 0$, we are done. If $r < b$, then $\frac{a}{b} = k + \frac{r}{b} > k$, so we can write $a = kb + r = (k+1)b + (r-b)$. By the induction hypothesis, $a = (k+1)b + (r-b)$ can also be written as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$, so $a$ can be written as a linear combination of $a$ and $b$.
A.388	 (b) In this case, there is a unique solution for the system when the determinant of the coefficient matrix is not zero and the number of equations equals the number of unknowns. This occurs when $k=\frac{1}{10}$. (c) In this case, there are infinitely many solutions when the determinant of the coefficient matrix is zero and the number of equations equals the number of unknowns. This occurs when $k=\frac{1}{10}$. Solution: $k=\boxed{\frac{1}{10}}$ for both (b) and (c).</s>
A.389	 If r is a constant, as N approaches infinity, the sum of the series will converge to a constant. If r is a function of N, the sum of the series will not converge to a constant but rather to a function of N. Let me know if you need more information. Comment: It converges to a constant for $r=1$ and to a function of $N$ for all other real $r$. Comment: It may not be a function of $N$ @YvesDaoust if $r$ is not a constant. Comment: I'm sorry, $r$ is a constant @YvesDaoust, I did not see that properly. Answer: The series converges to a constant, namely $\frac{1+r}{r^2}$, when $r\neq 1$. For $r=1$, the series is $\sum_{i=1}^N i$, which diverges as $N\to\infty$. Answer: If $r = 1$ then the sum is $\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$. If $r \neq 1$ then the sum is $\frac{1+r}{r^2} - \frac{r}{r^2} = \frac{1}{r^2}$ which doesn't depend on $N$. For any other $r$, the sum is $\frac{1}{r^2}$ which doesn't depend on $N$. So the sum converges to a constant for all $r \neq 1$, but doesn't for $r = 1$. In other words: the series doesn't converge to a constant when $r = 1$, but does for all other values of $r$.</s>
A.391	 HINT: use the inequality $(a+b)^r \le 2^r (a^r + b^r)$ for positive $a$ and $b$. Apply this to $\mathbb{E}[|X+Y|^r]$ and $\mathbb{E}[|X|^r]$ to get that $\mathbb{E}[|X+Y|^r] \le 2^r (\mathbb{E}[|X|^r] + \mathbb{E}[|Y|^r])$ for any $r \ge 1$. The case $r=0$ is trivial. For $r=1$, the inequality simplifies to $\mathbb{E}[|X+Y|] \le \sqrt{2} (\mathbb{E}[|X|] + \mathbb{E}[|Y|]$. The case $r>1$ is not much harder using the inequality $\mathbb{E}[|X+Y|^r] \le \mathbb{E}[|X|^r] + \mathbb{E}[|Y|^r]$. Comment: I'm sorry but how do I get that constant $c_r$ using the inequality? I've worked with the inequalities but I get stuck when dealing with the constant. Comment: This is not a constant but a function of $r$. For $r \le 1$, $c_r = 1$ because the inequality becomes $\mathbb{E}[|X+Y|] \le \sqrt{2} (\mathbb{E}[|X|] + \mathbb{E}[|Y|]$ which is bounded by $1 \cdot (\sqrt{2} (\sqrt{2})$, namely $2$. For $r > 1$, $c_r = 2^{r-1}$ because $\mathbb{E}[|X+Y|^r] \le 2^r (\mathbb{E}[|X|^r] + \mathbb{E}[|Y|^r]$. Comment: How do I show that $\mathbb{E}[|X+Y|] \le \sqrt{2} (\mathbb{E}[|X|] + \mathbb{E}[|Y|]$? Also, for the case $r=1$, it's just $2^0=1$ right? Comment: For the case $r
A.394	" Comment: So firstly, it would be $\epsilon$-$\delta$ continuity, not $\epsilon'-$\delta$ continuity, and secondly, that's not how you'd define continuity of a function, you can't say ""for all $\epsilon$, there exists a $\delta$ such that $|x-a|<\delta$ implies $|f(x)-f(a)|<\epsilon$"", since this would imply that $f(x)=f(a)$ for all $x$ in the domain, which is clearly not the case here. Here, you need to consider the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches an irrational number $a$, which is $0$, and show that it equals $f(a)=1/n$ for some $n$. This can be done by noting that for any rational number $a=\frac{m}{n}$, we have $f(a)=\frac{1}{n}$, and for any irrational number $x$, $f(x)=0$. This gives us the inequality $|f(x)-f(a)|=|0-1/n|=\frac{1}{n}<\epsilon$ for all $\epsilon>0$ (take $\delta=\frac{1}{n}$ for example). Answer: I would use the $\epsilon-\delta$ definition of continuity here. We want to show that for any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x$, if $|x - a| < \delta$, then $|f(x) - f(a)| < \epsilon$. Since $f(x) = 0$ for all $x$ irrational and $f(a) = \frac{1}{n}$, all we need to show is that given any $\epsilon > 0$, we can find a $\delta > 0$ such that for all $x$, if $|x - a| < \delta$, then $|1/n| < \epsilon$. We can do this by setting $\delta = \frac{1}{n}$, since then $|1/n| < |1/n| = \epsilon \Leftrightarrow n > \frac{1}{\epsilon}$. This would work for all $n > 1$, but we need to take the smallest such $n$"
