A.301	  Sure, I can help you with that. To prove the inequality, we can start by using the Cauchy Schwartz inequality for matrices. The Cauchy Schwartz inequality for matrices states that for any $A$ and $B$ matrices of the same size, we have $$\|AB\|_2^2\leq\|A\|_2\|B\|_2.$$ Since we want to prove a bound on $\|AB\|_2^2$, we can start by rearranging the inequality to get $$\|AB\|_2^2\leq\|A\|_2\|B\|_2.$$ We can then apply this inequality multiple times, where the matrix $A$ is a row matrix and $B$ is a column vector. Specifically, let $A$ be a $1\times n$ row matrix and $B$ be an $m\times 1$ column vector. Then $$\|AB\|_2=\|BTA\|_2=\|B\|_2\|T\|_2 \leq\|B\|_2\|A\|_2 \leq\|BA\|_2,$$ where $T$ is the transpose of $A$. Now, let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix and $B$ be an $n\times 1$ column vector. Then $$\|AB\|_2=\|BTA\|_2=\|B\|_2\|T\|_2 \leq\|B\|_2\|A\|_2 \leq\|BA\|_2,$$ where $T$ is the transpose of $A$. We can continue this process for each of the $m\times n$ possible combinations of row and column matrices. Using the Cauchy Schwartz inequality, we can thus bound the sum of $\|AB\|_2^2$ by a sum of $\|A\|_2\|B\|_2$'s for all possible row and column matrices. Now, let's consider the following $m\times n$ matrix $$\boxed{C=\begin{pmatrix} v_1 & v_2 & \cdots & v_m \\ v_{m+1} & v_{m+2} & \cdots & v_{2m}
A.302	  The problem you are referring to asks for the solutions to the equation $z^n=w$ where $z \in \mathbb{C}$ for a natural number $n$. In other words, you are asked to find the roots of this equation. It is true that any complex number can be written in the form $z=se^{i{\phi}}$ where $s\ge0$ and $\phi \in \mathbb{R}$. Therefore, the roots of the equation $z^n=w$ can be written in the form: $$z=\sqrt[n]{s}e^{\frac{i\varphi}{n}}$$ However, it is not necessary that each natural number has a root of this form. In fact, not all natural numbers have a root of the form $z=\sqrt[n]{s}e^{\frac{i\varphi}{n}}$ if they are odd. For example, the natural number 3 has no roots of this form. In summary, there may be multiple solutions to the equation $z^n=w$ depending on the natural number $n$ and the values of $s$ and $\varphi$. It is not always possible to identify a unique solution.
A.303	  One possible way to prove that $[x,y]=x$ and $[y,x]=-x$ is through linear algebra. Let $V$ be a vector space of dimension 2 and let $x,y$ be a basis for $V$. We can define a linear operator $D: V \times V \to V$ as follows: $$D(x,y) = [x, y]$$ Now, let's check that $D$ satisfies the Jacobi identity $D(D(x,y), z) = D(z, D(x,y))$ for all $x, y, z \in V$. $$D(D(x,y), z) = D(x, y + z) - D(y, z) = [x,y+z] - [y,z] = D(z, D(x,y))$$ $$D(z, D(x,y)) = D(x+z, y) - D(x, y + z) = [x+z, y] - [x, y + z] = D(y, D(x,z))$$ $$D(y, D(x,z)) = D(x, z + y) - D(x, y + z) = [x,z+y] - [x,y+z] = D(D(x,z), y) = D(D(y,x), z)$$ Since $D$ satisfies the Jacobi identity, it follows that $[x,y]=[y,x]$ and $D(x,y)=D(y,x)=0$. This implies that $[x,y]=0$ and $[y,x]=0$, which are the conditions that define a Lie algebra $L(2,K)$. Therefore, $[x,y]=x$ and $[y,x]=-x$ are the only possible values for $[x,y]$ that make the bracket satisfy the conditions of a Lie algebra $L(2,K)$. As for why these values of $[x,y]$ are always the same, it is because in order for the bracket to satisfy the Jacobi identity, it must be equal to
A.304	  In fact, there is a simpler proof. Let $X$ be a non-orientable real surface. Suppose $X$ admits a quasi-complex structure, as we will show in the following proof that this is a contradiction. Let $t$ be any smooth curve on $X$ with length $1$. Since $X$ is non-orientable, there exists a smooth curve $q$ on $X$ such that the orientation of $X$ changes as we move along $q$. Without loss of generality, assume that $t$ and $q$ intersect at a single point. Since $X$ is non-orientable, there exists a non-contractible loop $L$ in $X$ such that the homotopy group $\pi_1(X, t)=[-,L]$ is nontrivial, where $[t,L]\in H_1(X)$. Since $t$ and $q$ intersect at a single point, there exists a non-contractible loop $K$ in $X$ such that the homotopy group $\pi_1(X, q)=[-,K]\in H_1(X)$ is nontrivial. Now suppose that $X$ admits a quasi-complex structure, say $$D = T_X^{0,1} \oplus T_X^{0,2},$$ where $T_X^{0,1}$ and $T_X^{0,2}$ are the bundles of $(0,1)$-forms and $(0,2)$-forms, respectively. Since $X$ is a real surface, $\dim H_0(X)=1$. Therefore, we have a smooth map $$S : \pi_1(X) \to D_0$$ such that the image of each loop $\gamma \in \pi_1(X)$ is a vector in $D_0 =T_X^{0,0}$. Let $M=(t)$, $N=(q)$, and $L=(L)$. Since $[t,L]\in H_1(X)$, there exists a smooth map $$P : [0,1] \to X$$ such that $P(0)=M$ and $P(1)=L$, and such that the homotopy group $\pi_1(X, t) = [P, K]\in H_1(X)$
A.305	  In order to find the value of the floor function of the following expression, we need to use the fact that the sum of an infinite geometric series with first term $a$ and common ratio $r$ converges to $\frac{a}{1-r}$ if $r<1$. Let's first find the general term of the expression $\sum\limits_{r=1}^N\frac{1}{2^r}$. We know that in a geometric series, the general term is given by $ar^{r-1}$. So, in this case, the general term is $\frac{1}{2^r}$. Now, let's think of the expression as an infinite geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio $2^{-1}$. We can verify that this series converges to 1 using the formula we discussed earlier: $\frac{a}{1-r} = \frac{1}{1-2^{-1}} = \frac{1}{1-2+2^{-2}+2^{-3}+\cdots} = \frac{1}{1-2+2^{-1}+2^{-2}+2^{-3}+\cdots} = \lim\limits_{N\to\infty}1+2^{-1}+2^{-2}+2^{-3}+\cdots + 2^{-N} = 1$. Since the expression is an infinite geometric series, we can find its sum using the formula $\frac{a}{1-r}$. In this case, $a=1$ and $r=2^{-1}$. Therefore, $\lim\limits_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{1-2^{-1}} = \lim\limits_{N\to\infty}\frac{1}{2^N - 1} = -1$. However, the infinite geometric series we constructed in the previous answer has no value in the real numbers, as its terms continue to diverge to infinity. Therefore, the value of the floor function of the expression $\sum\limits_{r=1}^N\frac{1}{2^r}$ is undefined. So, the answer to the problem is that the value of the floor function of $\lim\limits_{N\to\infty}\left\lfloor\sum\limits_{r=1}^N\frac{1}{2^r}\right\rfloor$ is undefined
A.306	  The irrationality of Euler's constant $\gamma$ is an important problem in mathematics, and it has been studied for centuries. While it may appear that the expansion you mentioned could be a proof of irrationality, it is not so because it can be manipulated algebraically to prove that $\gamma$ is rational. For example, it can be rearranged to the form: $$ B = \ln(2) + \sum_p \log\left( 1 - \frac{1}{p}\right) - \zeta(1) $$ where $\zeta(1)$ is the Riemann zeta function. This form has been used to provide a proof of the rationality of $\gamma$ by using the fact that $\zeta(1)$ is rational. Furthermore, despite the infinite number of prime numbers, the primes alone are not sufficient to prove irrationality. For example, the expansion of $\pi$ in terms of its prime factorization $$ \pi = \sum_p \frac{1}{p} \left( \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{k} - \sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{1}{kp} \right) $$ also appears to indicate irrationality, but it has been proven to be a rational number, known as the Leibniz formula. In summary, while the expansion you mentioned provides a useful tool for approximating the value of $\gamma$, it is not sufficient to prove irrationality, as it can be manipulated algebraically to demonstrate rationality.
A.307	  The Carmichael function $\lambda(n)$ is defined as follows: for a positive integer $n$, $\lambda(n)$ is equal to the smallest positive integer $t$ such that $a^t\equiv1\pmod n$ for all integers $a$ with $\gcd(a,n)=1$. To see why $\lambda(n)=\max\{\operatorname{ord}_n(x):\gcd(x,n)=1\}$ is true, we can use induction on $n$. Base case: if $n=2$, then $\lambda(2)=1$, and $\max\{\operatorname{ord}_2(x):\gcd(x,n)=1\}$ is equal to $\max\{\operatorname{ord}_2(x):1\}=1$. Substituting $\lambda(x)=\operatorname{ord}_x(x)$ into the definition of $\lambda(n)$, we get $\max\{\operatorname{ord}_x(x):1\}=1$, which is clearly true for $n=2$. Inductive step: assume that $\lambda(k-1)=\max\{\operatorname{ord}_k(x):\gcd(x,k)=1\}$ for some odd integer $k$, and show that $\lambda(k)=\max\{\operatorname{ord}_k(x):\gcd(x,k)=1\}$. To do this, let $\lambda_k$ be the smallest positive integer such that $x^t\equiv1\pmod k$ for all integers $x$ with $\gcd(x,k)=1$. Then by induction, we have $\lambda(k-1)=\max\{\operatorname{ord}_k(x):x^r\equiv1\pmod k\}$ for $r<\lambda_k$, which means $\lambda(k-1)<\lambda_k$. Now, let $x$ be the smallest positive integer such that $x^r\equiv1\pmod k$ for $r>\lambda(k-1)$. Since $k$ is odd, $x$ must be an odd integer as well. But then, if $x$ were coprime to $k-1$, then $x^r$ would also be coprime to $k-1$ for some $r<\lambda
A.308	  Riemann's Integral Representation of Zeta Function Riemann's integral representation of zeta function is given by $$\zeta(s)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(s)}\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x-1}dx.$$ This integral is valid for $\mbox{Re}(s)\gt 1$, where the gamma function $\Gamma(s)$ can be continued analytically to complex values of $s$. However, the integral diverges for $\mbox{Re}(s)\leq 1$ and is even not defined for $\mbox{Re}(s)=1$. Moreover, the original integral over $[0,\infty)$ is also divergent if $\mbox{Re}(s)\leq 1$. To extend the integral to a function defined for all complex values of $s$ except $\mbox{Re}(s)=1$, Riemann introduced a contour $C$ along with its Hankel contour and took the limit of the integral along $C$ for $C\rightarrow R$, where $R$ is a large circle around the origin, such that $R$ does not contain the singularity $s=1$. Riemann's integral representation involves a function with singularities at $s=1$, which is analytic everywhere else. This means that the path in the complex plane must be chosen carefully to avoid the singularity, which can be achieved by taking an appropriate radius $\delta$ for the circle $R$ such that $s=1$ lies outside $R$ and $\delta$ is small enough for the path to be far enough away from the singularity. To explain the integral representation of the zeta function, let us consider the integral $$\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x-1}dx.$$ If we use the Euler form $e^x=e^{i\pi x}$, then we have the following expression for the integral: $$\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{s-1}}{e^x-1}dx=\frac{\Gamma(s-1)}{2\pi i}\int_0^\infty e^{i\pi(s-1)}x^{s-2}dx.$$ Notice that $\Gamma(s-1)$
A.309	  Yes, there is an elementary and straightforward proof for this conclusion. We will start by noting that $\mathbb{F}_p$ is a field of order $p$, so that it contains $p$ elements. We know that the equation $x^3=a$ is cubic in $x$, which means that each individual equation has three roots. However, we need to count the number of distinct roots of this equation for each $a\in \mathbb{F}_p$. To do this, we will use the fact that $\gcd(3,p-1)=1$. This means that we can use modular arithmetic to relate the cubic roots of $x^3=a$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$ to the cubic roots of $x^3$ modulo $p-1$. Specifically, we can use the following observation: since $a=a_0+a_1p+a_2p^2+a_3p^3$, the equation $x^3=a$ is true for the root $x_1=a_3p^{-1} \bmod p$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$. Moreover, we know that $p-1$ is relatively prime to $p$ (since $\gcd(p-1,p)=1$), so that using modular arithmetic, we can relate $x_1$ to the other two cubic roots, which we will call $x_2$ and $x_3$. In more detail, if we write $x=x_0+x_1p+x_2p^2+x_3p^3$, then we have $a=(x_3p^{-1})^3 \bmod p$, which means that the roots of $x^3=a$ in $\mathbb{F}_p$ are related to the roots of $x^3=1$ modulo $p-1$ by a set of homomorphisms: $$x_1\mapsto p^{-1}\bmod p\equiv p^{-1}(\bmod p-1)$$ $$x_0\mapsto x_0 (\bmod p)$$ $$x_2\mapsto (x_2+px_0 (\bmod p)+x_1(p-1)) (\b
A.310	  There are many different methods to find solutions to problems involving fractions, but one common technique is to use variables to represent the denominators. In this case, let's denote the denominator of x as dx and the denominator of y as dy. Then the equation $\frac{4}{x}+\frac{10}{y}=1$ becomes $dx-\frac{4}{x}(dy-1)=10$ or $(dx-20)\cdot\frac{1}{(-2y+1)}=1$, which can be simplified by dividing both sides by (-2y+1). This gives us $dx-\frac{20}{(-2y+1)}=1$, which can be rearranged to solve for dx: $dx=\frac{20}{(-2y+1)}+1=\frac{20(y-2)}{(-2y+1)(y-3)}$. We can then express y in terms of x as $y=\frac{x(2y-1)}{dx+20}$, which gives us $y=\frac{x(2y-1)}{2x-20+20}=\frac{x(2y-1)}{2x-20}$. This can be simplified by dividing both sides by $2(y-1)$: $y=\frac{x}{2(y-1)}$. Thus, we have found that the solutions to $\frac{4}{x}+\frac{10}{y}=1$ are $x=2$ and $y=1$ or $x=2$ and $y=\frac{2}{3}$.
A.312	  The formula $\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor\frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor$ for positive integers $a$, $b$, and $c$ is true. To prove it, we can assume that it is false, and show that in this case there is a contradiction. Suppose $\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor \neq \left\lfloor\frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor$. Then there are two possible cases: 1) $\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor\frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor$: Note that $\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor =\left\lfloor \frac{a/b}{c} \right\rfloor$. Therefore, $\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor > \left\lfloor\frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor$ means that $a/bc > \left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor \cdot c$ or $a > bbc$. But this is a contradiction because $\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor$ is an integer, and $a$ is an integer. 2) $\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor < \left\lfloor\frac{a}{bc} \right\rfloor$: Note that $\left\lfloor \frac{\left\lfloor \frac{a}{b} \right\rfloor}{c} \right\rfloor =\left\lfloor \frac{\left\
A.313	  Your solution is correct! Thank you for your help!
A.314	  To prove that the closed span of $\{x_n\}$ is $H$ given $\sum \|e_n-x_n\| < 1$, we can use the fact that the closed span of a finite set of vectors is closed under linear combinations of those vectors. Specifically, if $x = a_1 e_1 + \cdots + a_n e_n$, then $a_1 x_1 + \cdots + a_n x_n \in \emph{span}\{x_n\}$, since $x_i$ is a linear combination of the basis elements $\{e_n\}$. Assuming $\emph{span}\{x_n\}$ is a closed subspace of $H$, we can show that the vector $e_n - x_n$ is in $\emph{span}\{x_n\}$ for all $n$. This is because: $e_n - x_n = c(e_1 - x_1) + \cdots + c(e_{n-1} - x_{n-1}) + e_n$ where $c_i = a_i - \alpha_i$. Since $\alpha_i = e_n^{\top} (e_n-x_n)$ and $x_1, \cdots, x_n \in \emph{span}\{x_n\}$, we know that $\alpha_i \in \emph{span}\{x_n\}$. Thus, $c(e_1 - x_1) + \cdots + c(e_{n-1} - x_{n-1}) \in \emph{span}\{x_n\}$. Therefore, $e_n - x_n \in \emph{span}\{x_n\}$. Now, since $\sum \|e_n-x_n\| < 1$, we know that $e_n \in \emph{span}\{x_n\}$ for all $n$. To see this, we can use the fact that $\emph{span}\{x_n\}$ is a closed subspace of $H$ and $e_n$ is in $\emph{span}\{e_1-x_1, \cdots, e_n - x_n\}$. But since $e_i
A.315	  Your proof looks correct so far! It shows that backwards induction by taking the principle backwards from $n$ to $0$, using the $n$th step to establish the $n\text{++}$th step, and then using the $n\text{++}$th step to establish the $n$th step. You also used a similar approach for the initial step, where you used the $0$th to establish $n$th step. Overall, your proof is a good example of backwards induction and shows why there is a principle of backwards induction, which states that if a statement holds at the nth step given a sequence of statements, then it must hold at every previous step in the sequence.
A.316	  The group (Z/2^m\Z)^* of units in Z/2^m\Z is an abelian group with order 2^(m-1). This is well-known and it is also known that it has a unique (up to isomorphism) decomposition into cyclic groups C\_2. However, the specific representation of C\_2 as factors requires some computation. One simple approach to find the decomposition of (Z/2^m\Z)^* is to start with the case m=1, which is given by (Z/2\Z)^*=C\_1, the group of integers modulo 2. Since there are no elements of order 4 in Z/2\Z, there is no need to combine C\_2 and C\_2 into C\_4, and thus for m=1 we have (Z/2^m\Z)^*=C\_2. For m>1, we proceed inductively. Assume that (Z/2^k\Z)^*=C\_2\times C\_2,\cdots\times C\_2, where k=m-2. Then, when taking (Z/2^m\Z)^*=(Z/2^k\Z)^*/(Z/2^(k+1)\Z), there is a canonical homomorphism f:Z/2^(k+1)\Z\to Z/2^(k+1)\Z/(Z/2^m\Z)^*=C\_1. The kernel of f is given by the elements of order 2^(k+1) in Z/2^(k+1)\Z, which form a subgroup K of ((Z/2^k\Z)*)^*. The order of K is 2^(k+2-m), and thus (Z/2^(k+1)\Z)^*/(K) has order 2^(m-3) and is therefore isomorphic to C\_4. Thus, we get a decomposition (Z/2^(k+1)\Z)^*=C\_2\times C\_2\times C\_4\times C\_2^(m-k-2), with C\_2^(m-k-2) arising from considering the image (Z/2^k
A.317	  Let be $n\in \mathbb{Z_+}$. Find the value of the integral: $$\int \frac{1}{\left(x^2+1\right)^n}dx$$ To solve this integral, we can use the substitution $y = x^2 + 1$. Then, we have $dy/dx = 2x$ and $dx = dy/(2x)$. Using this substitution, the integral becomes: $$\int \frac{1}{\left(x^2+1\right)^n}dx = \int \frac{1}{\left(\frac{y}{2x}\right)^n} dx = \int \frac{1}{\left(\frac{y}{2x}\right) ^n} \frac{dy}{2x}$$ Now, we use the substitution $u = \frac{y}{2x}$. Then we have $du = \frac{dy}{2x}$ and $dx = -2*du/y$. $$ \int \frac{1}{\left(\frac{y}{2x}\right) ^n} \frac{dy}{2x} = \int \frac{1}{u^n} du \times \frac{dx}{-2du/y} = -\int \frac{1}{u^n} du \times \frac{dx}{2du/y}$$ Next, we use the substitution $v = u^2 - 2x+1$, then we have $dv/du = 2u - 2$ and $du = (dv/2u - 1)dv/(2u^2)$ $$\int \frac{1}{u^n} du \times \frac{dx}{2du/y} = -\int \frac{1}{u^n} (dv/2u - 1)dv/(2u^2)$$ We can see that $$(2u^2 - 2u) \left(\int \frac{1}{u^n}(dv/2u-1)dv +C\right) = x\left(\int \frac{1}{u^n}(dv/2u-1)dv+C\right)$$ where $$C = \frac{1}{2}\int
A.318	  To extend this proof to the non-integer case, we can use the definition of limits. Specifically, we can use the property that if $\lim_{n \to \infty} (\frac{d}{dx} g(x)) = L$ then $\lim_{n \to \infty} g(x) = L$. In this case, we define $g(x) = e^x$ and $\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = e^x$. Then, we can rearrange the inequality we derived as $\frac{d}{dx} e^x - e^x \leq 0$, which implies $e^x - e^x = -\frac{d}{dx} e^x \leq 0$. Solving for $ e^x$, we get $e^x \geq -1$, which is clearly true for any real $n \geq 1$ and satisfies the base case. We can also use the intermediate value theorem to prove that $e^x - \left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n} \leq 0$. Specifically, we first note that $f(x) = e^x - \left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n}$ is continuous on the interval $[0, \frac{x}{n}]$. By the intermediate value theorem, there exists a point $\xi \in (0, \frac{x}{n})$ such that $f(\xi) = 0$. Then we can rewrite $g(x) = e^x - \left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n} = \left(e^x - \left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n}\right) - \left(1-\frac{x}{n}\right)$. Taking $\frac{d}{dx} g(x) = -e^x + n-x = -1$, we have $g(\frac{x}{n}) = n -x$, which is strictly positive for any $x \in (0, n]$. Therefore, $\left(e^x - \left(1+\frac{x}{n}\right)^{n}\right) - \left(1-\frac{x}{n}\right) \leq n-x \leq 0$. Solving for $ e
A.319	  The argument assumes that all countable subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ are contained in $\mathbb{R}$. This assumption is incorrect. For example, $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{R}$, but $\mathbb{N}$ is a countable set and is not contained in $\mathbb{R}$. Thus, the argument is incorrect and cannot be relied upon to prove that $\mathbb{R}$ is countable.
A.320	  Your solution for the integral is correct. To add a little more detail to your explanation, you first recognize that the integral $\int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \frac{t}{\sin(t)}\cos(t)dt$ can be re-written using the trigonometric substitution $x = \sin(t)$ and $t = \arcsin(x)$. This simplifies your integral to $\int_0^1 \frac{\arcsin(x)}{x}dx$ which is what you initially started with. Next, you make a substitution using integration by parts to find an expression that is easier to integrate. $u = t$ and $dv = \cot(t)dt$. Integrating by parts twice, we obtain $u = \frac{\pi}{2}$ and $v = \arctan(t)$. Thus, $\arcsin(t) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \arctan(t)$. This substitution allows us to integrate $\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} t\cot(t)dt$ as follows: $\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} t\cot(t)dt = [\arcsin(t)]_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}} = \arcsin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) - \arcsin(0) = \pi - 0 = \pi$ Since you mentioned the boundary values, it is clear that the integral $\int_0^{1}\frac{\arcsin(x)}{x}dx$ is equal to $\pi$. In general, it is not possible to evaluate the integral $\int_0^{1}\frac{\arcsin(x)}{x}dx$ explicitly, as there is no closed form for the hypergeometric function $\arcsin(x)$. However, your solution using integration by parts is a valid way to find the definite integral, and it provides a numerical estimate for its value.
A.322	  Your result is correct. You have calculated the sum of triangular numbers by summing the squares of all integers from 1 to n, starting from 1. This is known as the "diagonalization" of the triangular numbers. To see why this is correct, consider a triangle with n sides, where each side has length a_n, and the triangle has an area of b_n. Let m be the midpoint of the base of the triangle. Then, the sides are also the diagonal of two right triangles, one with legs of length m-a_n and m+a_n, and the other with legs of length a_n-m and a_n+m. The area of the square formed by the intersection of these two right triangles is b_n (which is also half the area of the original triangle). Now, if you add up the areas of all the squares formed by the intersection of the two right triangles for all n, you get the sum of triangular numbers. So, $c_n = \sum_{m=1}^n {a_n}^2 = \sum_{m=1}^{n} {(\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2} = (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2 + (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2 - (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2 + (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2 + ... + (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2 - (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2 + (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2 = (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2$ Therefore, c_n = a_n^2 = b_n = (\frac{n(n+1)}{2})^2$ for all n, including n=1. So, yes, your result is correct. Your method of adding up the squares of the integers from 1 to n is a valid way to calculate the sum of the sum of triangular numbers.
A.324	  To sum up the Double Basel problem, the original series is the sum of all fractions of the form ${1\over n^2+m^2}$ for $(n,m)\geq 1$. The generalized result is that the double sum of the fractions can be expressed as the sum of arctangent and cotangent functions. Specifically, the double sum can be written as $$\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{x^2+m^2} = \frac{1}{2x}\left[ \pi \coth{\pi x} - \frac{1}{x}\right].$$ Hence, the original Double Basel problem can be expressed as the sum of the following expression: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2n}\left[\pi \coth{\pi n} - \frac{1}{n} \right].$$ Now, we need to evaluate this expression to determine if it converges or diverges. If the series converges, then we need to find out what its value is. To begin, we can notice that the arctangent and cotangent functions both grow without bound as $x$ approaches zero from the right. Therefore, it would be likely that the $\coth$ term in the expression will eventually approach negative infinity, causing the entire expression to diverge to negative infinity. To confirm this, we can explicitly evaluate the expression for $x=1$: $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2n}\left[\pi \coth{\pi n} - \frac{1}{n}\right]$$ $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2n}\left[\frac{\pi}{\sin{\pi n}} - \frac{1}{n}\right]$$ $$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} - \frac{\pi^2}{2n^3} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\pi}{2n^2} - \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2n}$$ Since we can sum up the second term and third term using the integral test, we can ignore those terms: $$\sum_{n=
A.325	  This method to find 100 consecutive composite numbers requires iterating through each value of n from 2 to 10, finding the sum of the first n natural numbers plus 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10, and then adding additional values to that sum based on the value of n. Once you have the sum for a given n, you should check whether it is divisible by 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 or 9 or 10. If the sum is divisible by any of these values, then it is a composite number and should be added to the list of consecutive composite numbers. This approach will require at least 560 calculations, and since the iteration must be repeated for each value of n from 2 to 10, the total number of iterations could be much larger depending on the desired number of consecutive composite numbers. However, this method does not provide a direct way to generate a list of consecutive composite numbers that does not require checking each value of n. There are other more efficient methods to generate a sequence of prime and composite numbers. One such method is to use the primes as a starting point, and then add consecutive integers until a composite number is reached. Another method is to use the properties of number theory to generate a sequence of composite numbers by combining smaller composite numbers of known prime factors. However, these methods may require more mathematical knowledge and expertise than the iterative method described in the passage.
A.326	  The statement "Every module is a homomorphic image of a free module" implies that every module can be obtained by applying a homomorphism (a linear transformation) to a free module. In particular, this means that every module can be obtained by applying a linear transformation to a free module with zero remainder, which means that it can be obtained as a direct summand of a free module. For a projective module, this means that it can be obtained as a direct summand of a free module by applying a linear transformation to the free module and requiring that the remainder be zero. This is exactly what it means for the module to be projective. Therefore, we see that if $P$ is a projective module, it must be a direct summand of a free module.
A.327	  The determinant of a $3\times 3$ matrix $\begin{vmatrix} a & b &c \\ d &e &f\\ g &h & i \end{vmatrix}$ is the volume of a parallelopiped with its three sides as the vectors whose tails rest on origin and heads at the coordinates $(ab+fh,dh+gh,dh+ag+fh)$. Proof: When a $3\times 3$ matrix is multiplied by its transpose, the resulting matrix is the $3\times 3$ identity matrix. This is true for $\begin{vmatrix} a & b &c\\ d &e &f\\ g &h & i\end{vmatrix}$ too. Moreover, the product of the $2\times 3$ submatrices $\begin{vmatrix} a & b &c\\ g & h & i\end{vmatrix}$ and $\begin{vmatrix} d & e & f\\ h & i & -f\end{vmatrix}$ is the $2\times 2$ identity matrix. The product of the $2\times 2$ submatrices $\begin{vmatrix} d & e & f\\ h & i & -f\end{vmatrix}$ and $\begin{vmatrix} a & b &c\\ g & h & i\end{vmatrix}$ is $\begin{bmatrix} dg-de+fh & de-bh-eg & dh-eg+bf \\ -dh+g-fi & eh+g-f & ei-dh+fh \end{bmatrix}$. The determinant of this matrix is $[(dh-fh)^2+(fh-eh)^2+(dh-eg)^2]\begin{vmatrix} dh-eg+bf \\ eh+g-fi \end{vmatrix} +(dh-eh)(dh+bf)(dh+fi)$ , which can be simplified as $(dh-fh)^2+(fh-eh)^2+(dh-eg)^2=(dh-eg-(eh-dh))^2$ and $dh-eg+bf=(dh+bf)(dh+fi)$ $\times (dh-eg+bf)+(dh-eh)(dh+bf)(dh+fi)=(dh-eh)(
A.328	  The given equation can be proven using the fact that the sum of squares of cosines of $nk$'s is equal to one. We can write: $$ 1=\frac{ 2\cdot 2 \cdot \cos^2\left( \frac{2\pi}{2} \right) + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot \cos^2\left( \frac{ 2 \pi}{2} \right)+2 \cdot 2 \cdot \cos^2\left( \frac{ 2 \pi}{2} \right) }{ 2^2} $$ $$=\frac{ 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1+ 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1+ 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 }{ 4} $$ $$=\frac{ 4 }{ 4}$$$$=1$$ We can generalize this to $n$ as follows: $$1=\frac{2n^2(\sin^2\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)-\cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right))}{2^n}$$ Now we can substitute $\frac{2k\pi}{n}$ for $\frac{\pi}{n}$ and rewrite the equation as the sum of squares of cosines of $nk$'s. Therefore, we have: $$1=\frac{2n^2(\sin^2\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)-\cos^2\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right))}{2^n}$$$$= \frac{2n^2(\sin^2\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)- 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)+ 2\cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right))}{2^n}$$$$=\frac{2n^2(\sin^2\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right)+ \sin\left(\frac{2\pi k}{n}\right) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right)+ 2\cos^2\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right))}{2n
A.329	  Yes, certainly! Here's one way to prove that $A \subseteq V \subseteq \overline{V} \subseteq U$ while also showing that $A \subseteq \overline{V}$ and $V \subseteq U$: First, note that $V$ is open since $U$ is open and $p \in A$ implies $A \subseteq U$. Therefore, there exists an open neighbourhood $W$ of $p$ such that $p \in W$. Since $A$ is compact and $p \in A$ is an arbitrary point, we can cover $A$ with finitely many open neighbourhoods, say $W_1,\dots,W_n$, each of which is contained in $U$ and has $p \in W_i$, for some $i$. We can define $U'$ as the union of all these neighbourhoods, that is, $U' = \bigcup_{i=1}^n W_i$. Since $U$ is open, $U'$ is also open. Moreover, $p \in U'$ is clear, since $p \in W_i$ for some $i$. Next, let's show that $\overline{V} \subseteq U'$. To see this, note that $V$ is a neighbourhood of $p$, so there exists an open neighbourhood $V_i$ of $p$ such that $V_i \cap V_j = \emptyset$ for $i \neq j$. Since $V \subseteq \overline{V}$, we have $\overline{V_i} \subseteq \overline{V}$. But $V_i$ is open, so $\overline{V_i}$ is closed, and by the Correspondence Theorem, it is compact. Therefore, $\overline{V_i}$ is a compact open neighbourhood of $p$, and by the same argument as before, we can cover $A$ with finitely many such neighbourhoods. Now, let $V$ be the union of all these compact open neighbourhoods of $p$. Since each of these neighbourhoods is contained in $U$ and has $p \in W_i$, for some $i$, we have $V \subseteq U$. Moreover, $V$ is open since it is the union of a finite number
A.330	  The determinant of the original matrix is calculated as the product of two factors: $$\Delta=(x+a(n-1))(x-a)^{n-1}$$ The first factor is calculated by adding all the other columns to the first column. Therefore, we have the matrix: $$\begin{vmatrix} 1&a&a&\ldots&a\\ 1&&a&&\\ 1&&a&&\\ \cdot&&\cdot&&\\ 1&&a&& \end{vmatrix}$$ To calculate the determinant of this matrix, we can compute the $(n-1)$th order determinant of the minor diagonal, which consists of the intersection of all the $i$-th rows with all the $i$-th columns except for the first column. The minor determinant is $$\Delta_{n-1}= \begin{vmatrix} a&&a&&\\ \cdot&&\cdot&&\\ \cdot&&\cdot&&\\ \cdot&&\cdot&&\\ a&&a&& \end{vmatrix}=\prod_{j=2}^{n}(x-a)^{n-j+1}$$ The other factor in the original determinant is simply the product of the entries from the first column and that's why the answer is $$\Delta=(x+a(n-1))(x-a)^{n-1}$$
A.331	  Unfortunately, the equation $4^x+6^x=9^x$ is a polynomial equation of degree 2 and finding its roots using mathematical techniques such as completing the square or factoring is not possible for analytic methods. Therefore, it may be difficult or even impossible to find the roots of this equation by hand. It is important to note that analytic methods are only reliable for certain types of equations and are not always guaranteed to provide a solution. In this case, numerical methods such as using a calculator or computer program may be the only feasible option for finding the solution.
A.332	  The statement is: Any natural number can be expressed as a product of (least prime factor) * (largest integer dividing n less than n) Show that this is impossible (i.e., it is false).
A.333	  (Passage) Let $(X,Y)$ have a bivariate normal density centered at the origin with $E(X^2)$ = $E(Y^2) = 1$, and $E(XY) = p$. In polar coordinates $(R,\Phi)$, $R^2 = X^2 + Y^2$. Then, by symmetry of the bivariate normal density, $\Phi$ has a density given by $$\frac{\sqrt{1-p^2}}{2\pi(1-2p\sin(\Phi)\cos(\Phi))}$$ I understand that if $P\{XY > 0\} = \frac{1}{2} +\pi^{-1} \arcsin (p)$, then $P\{y = -x \sqrt{1-p^2}/p}\} = \sqrt{1-p^2}/p$ and $P\{y > -x \sqrt{1-p^2}/p}\} = \sqrt{1-p^2}/p$ . From this I conclude that $\Phi$ is uniformly distributed iff $p = 0$. I am unable to understand how to conclude that $P\{XY > 0\} = \frac{1}{2} +\pi^{-1} \arcsin (p)$ and $P\{XY < 0\} = \pi^{-1} \arccos (p)$. Can you help me understand this part? (Answer) To prove that $P\{XY > 0\}$ = $\frac{1}{2}$ + $\pi^{-1}$ $\arcsin(p)$ and $P\{XY < 0\}$ = $\pi^{-1}$ $\arccos(p)$, we use the definitions of the joint density of $(x,y)$ and polar density of $\Phi$. The joint density of $(x,y)$ is given by: $$\rho(x,y) = \frac{1}{8\pi^2}\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$$ where $x,y \geq 0$. In polar coordinates, $(x,y)$ becomes $(r,\theta)$ with $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and $\theta$ = $\arctan (y/x)$. The polar density of $\Phi$ is
A.337	  To prove that a curve with the property that all its tangent lines pass through a fixed point must be part of a straight line, one can assume that the curve is unit-speed and that all its tangent lines pass through the origin. This is because any non-unit speed curve $\gamma$ can be rescaled to unit-speed without changing the tangent line property (by dividing both the parametric equations and their derivatives by the appropriate scaling factor). Once $\gamma$ is unit-speed and passes through the origin, there is a scalar $\lambda(t)$ such that $\gamma'(t) = \lambda(t)\gamma(t)$ for all $t$. This is because the tangent lines at distinct points are unique and are perpendicular to the normals at those points. Therefore, the ratio of their slopes is constant. Moreover, the scalar $\lambda(t)$ can be found by evaluating the ratio of slopes of the tangent line at any two distinct points on the curve $\gamma$. Once we have $\lambda(t)$, we can write $\gamma'' = \lambda'\gamma + \lambda \gamma'$. Here, $\gamma'$ and $\gamma''$ denote the first and second derivatives, respectively, of $\gamma$; $\gamma'(t)$ and $\gamma''(t)$ denote the velocity vector and acceleration vector, respectively, at time $t$. We can see that if $\lambda$ is constant, $\gamma'' = 0$, which means that the velocity vector has constant speed (or direction). If $\lambda$ is not constant, we can write $\lambda' = a\gamma(t) + b$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. Then, $\gamma'' = a\gamma'(t) + b\gamma(t)$ or $\gamma'' = a(\lambda \gamma) + b \gamma$. This shows that $\gamma''$ is a linear combination of $\gamma$ and $\lambda \gamma$, which means that it has the same line integral property as $\gamma$; that is, the difference between the limits $\int_\mathcal{C} \gamma'' \cdot d\gamma$ and $\int_{\partial \mathcal{C}} \gamma'' \cdot d\Sigma$ is zero for any closed loop $\mathcal{C}$. Therefore, we can conclude that the curve $\gamma$ is part
A.338	  The equation $y = \frac{a+bx}{b-x}$ can be rearranged to $y(b-x) = a+bx$ or $y(b-x) = a$ if we consider $x=0$. This equation is a linear equation of degree one with two variables $x$ and $y$. Thus, the number of solutions for this equation in the set of integers is $\binom{n+1}{2} = \frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}$, where $n = \max\{b,0\}$ represents the highest possible value of $x$ that results in an integer solution for $y$. To find all integer solutions for the equation, we can substitute in integer values of $x$ from $0$ to $n$ and solve for $y$. Alternatively, we can use matrix inversion to solve for $y$ given $x$. We can form a matrix $A$ with rows $(0,0)$ and $(x,y)$, and a column vector of ones. Then, we can solve for $y$ using $A^{-1}$ and the column vector $(a,b)$. This method will give us all solutions for each $x$ and $y$ in the set of integers.
A.339	  Extension of Euclid's lemma To prove the extension of Euclid's lemma, we can use Bézout's lemma to find the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $c$. Let $d = gcd(a,c)$, then we have $a = dq$ and $c = dr$ for some integers $q,r$. Similarly, we can find the greatest common divisor of $b$ and $c$. Let $e = gcd(b,c)$ then we have $b = ew$ and $c = ev$ for some integers $w,v$. Now we have two equations for $a,b,c,d,e,q,r,w,v$. We can rearrange these equations to get $aq = dr,bw = ev$. The fact that $a,b$ are relatively prime implies that $d \cdot e = 1$. Therefore, we can cancel out the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $c$ in the second equation to get $aq = c$. Similarly, we can cancel out the greatest common divisor of $b$ and $c$ in the second equation to get $bw = b$. This shows that $aq = b$. Let $h = gcd(a,b)$ then we know that $hq = b$ and we can also cancel out the greatest common divisor of $h$ and $b$ in the third equation to get $hq = c$. This shows that $hq = b$. Therefore, we have shown that $aq = b$ and $hq = b$, so we must have $h = a$. This completes the proof of the extension of Euclid's lemma. This is a very elegant proof, and I've seen it in textbooks before, but I need to understand it more fully. Can you explain it more in your own words?
A.340	  To show that $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence, we need to show that for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists $n_0>0$ such that $|x_m - x_n| < \epsilon$ for all $m,n > n_0$. We are given that $|x_{n+1} - x_n| < \frac{1}{3^n}$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. This inequality holds for all $n \geq 1$, so we can choose $n_0=1$. Then, for all $m,n>1$, we have: $$ |x_m - x_n| \leq |x_m - x_{m-1}|\ + |x_{m-1} - x_{m-2}|\ + \cdots + |x_2 - x_1| \ + |x_1 - x_n| < \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{3^{m-1}} + \frac{1}{3^m} < \infty.$$ Thus, we have shown that for all $m,n>n_0=1$, $|x_m - x_n| < \infty$, which implies that $(x_n)$ is a Cauchy sequence.
A.342	  The passage is about Exponential random variables and their expected value for a large number of independent presentations. In this case, the question suggests that there are four students giving presentations, each of which is independent. This means that the time it takes for each presentation to end does not affect the time it takes for the others to end. The expected value of an Exponential random variable is $1/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the average rate of occurrence of the event. If the presentations are all independent, then we can calculate the expected time between each presentation by dividing the expected presentation length by the average inter-presentation rate. Therefore, the expected time between presentations is $10/4$ minutes, or $2.5$ minutes. Since each presentation is independent, the time to complete all four presentations is simply the sum of the expected times between each presentation. This gives us a total expected time of $(10/4) \times 4 = 20$ minutes. In this case, the passage suggests that the expected time is $40$ minutes, which is incorrect. The correct answer is $20$ minutes, which is the sum of the expected time between each presentation for each of the four presentations.
A.344	  Your example is indeed a counterexample that illustrates the limitations of the theorem. The theorem states that a collection of subsets of a nonempty set $X$ forms a subbasis for a uniquely defined topology on $X$ if and only if the intersection of any set of subsets in that collection is either in the collection or the entire set $X$. In your example, the collection $\mathcal{A} = \{\{a\}\}$ violates this condition because the intersection of $\mathcal{A}$ is not contained in $\mathcal{A}$ and is not equal to $X$. Therefore, $\mathcal{A}$ cannot form a subbasis for any topology on $X$. Your counterexample is a valid illustration of the conditions under which a collection of subsets can form a subbasis for a topology.
A.345	  To calculate the distance between two skew lines, one approach is to find a line segment that is perpendicular to both of them. This line segment can be found by taking the cross product of their director vectors. Let's first find the director vectors for the given lines. Let `r(x)` be the parametric equation of the first line, and `s(x)` be the parametric equation of the second line. `r(x)`: `x = 1, y = 1, z = λ - 2` `s(x)`: `x = μ, y = μ - 1, z = -1` The parametric equations for the director vectors are: ```diff dirr(x) = (∂x/∂t)r(x) ∂y/∂t)r(x) ∂z/∂t)r(x) = (0) (1) (1) dirs(x) = (∂x/∂t)s(x) ∂y/∂t)s(x) ∂z/∂t)s(x) = (0) (1) (-1) ``` The cross product of these director vectors gives us the normal vector of the line perpendicular to both lines: ```css np(x) = dirr(x) × dirs(x) = (-1, -1, 2) ``` Now we need to find a point where this line touches both lines. Let's call this point `p` and define it as: ```javascript p.r(u) = 0 p.s(u) = 0 ``` where `u` is the parameter of `np`. To solve this system of equations, we need to use matrix algebra. Define the matrix of coefficients as: ```lua A = [x1.r1 y1.r1 z1.r1 x2.r1 y2.r1 z2.r1 x1.s1 y1.s1 z1.s1 x2.s1 y2.s1 z
A.346	  The answer is that $0$ is indeed a lower bound for the set $\{ r \in \mathbb Q \mid r^2 >2, r>0 \}$, but it is not the greatest lower bound. A greatest lower bound, or glb, of a set $S$ is an element $a \in S$ such that every other element in $S$ is less than or equal to $a$. However, $0$ is not an element of this set since $0^2 = 0 > 2$. Since $0$ is not an element of the set and not a lower bound for the set, it cannot be the greatest lower bound for the set. Although there is no element in the set that satisfies the condition of being a glb, the set does have a supremum, which is the value at which there is no less element left in the set when the set is bounded from above by elements in the set. In this case, the supremum is infinity.
A.347	  To prove the claim, we need to consider two cases: 1. If the GCD of $(a, b) = 1$, then $a, b$ are relatively prime numbers. 2. If $a, b$ are relatively prime numbers, then their greatest common divisor is $1$. Therefore, we need to find two coprime integers $m$ and $n$ that satisfy $a+b = md$ and $a-b = nd$. By simplifying the equation $a+b = md$, we can write $a = md - b$, which means that $a$ and $a-b$ are coprime, and therefore their greatest common divisor is the same. Similarly, by simplifying the equation $a-b = nd$, we can write $b = nd + a$, which means that $b$ and $a+b$ are coprime, and therefore their greatest common divisor is the same. Therefore, we have shown that if the GCD of $(a, b) = 1$, then either the GCD of $(a+b, a-b) = 1$ or the GCD of $(a+b, a-b) = 2$. Now, let's consider the second case, where $a$ and $b$ are not coprime numbers. In this case, we need to find two coprime integers $m$ and $n$ that satisfy $a+b = md$ and $a-b = nd$. By dividing the two equations by $2$ and $2b$ and simplifying, we get: $a+b = (m+n)d$ and $a-b = (m-n)d$ $a = (m+n)d - b$ and $b = (m-n)d + (m+n)d$ Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get: $b = (m+n)d - (m+n)d + 2d$ Simplifying, we get: $b = 2d$
A.348	  Here is the relevant passage that might address your question: \begin{equation*} \det \begin{pmatrix} A & -B\\ B & A \end{pmatrix} = \delta(A+B) \det(A-B) - \delta(-A+B) \det(-A-B) \end{equation*} This is true because by the properties of determinants, we can distribute the determinant over the blocks, and the determinant of a matrix is multiplicative under addition and subtraction. So, we have: \begin{align*} \det \begin{pmatrix} A & -B\\ B & A \end{pmatrix} &= \det(A+B) \det(-B) \\ &= (-1)^{p(\det(A+B))} \det(A+B) \det(B) \end{align*} where $p(\det(A+B))$ is the parity of the determinant of $A+B$. Similarly, we have: \begin{align*} \det \begin{pmatrix} A & -B\\ B & A \end{pmatrix} &= \det(-A+B) \det(A) \\ &= (-1)^{q(\det(-A+B))} \det(-A+B) \det(A) \end{align*} where $q(\det(-A+B))$ is the parity of the determinant of $-A+B$. We can now subtract the second equation from the first to get: \begin{align* }, \det \begin{pmatrix} A & -B\\ B & A \end{pmatrix} &= (-1)^{p(\det(A+B))} \det(A+B) \det(B) - (-1)^{q(\det(-A+B))} \det(-A+B) \det(A) \\ &= \det(A+B) \det(B) + \det(-A+B) \det(A) \\ &= -2 \det(A+B) \det(A-B) \end{align*}
A.349	  As Stirling's Approximation is an approximation, there is no exact solution to it that can be easily derived. However, there are numerical methods that can be used to approximate the inverse function. One such method is to take the natural logarithm of both sides, which gives us: $$\ln(y) = \ln(\sqrt{2\pi x} * \frac{x}{e}^x)$$ Simplifying this expression, we get: $$\ln(y) = \ln(\sqrt{2\pi x} + \frac{x}{e})$$ Using the properties of logarithms, we can expand this expression as follows: $$\ln(y) = \ln\sqrt{2\pi x} + \ln\left(\frac{x}{e}\right)$$ Since the natural logarithm of 2πx is the log base e of 2πx, we can simplify this expression further as: $$\ln(y) = \ln(2\pi x) + \ln x$$ Taking the exponential of both sides of the equation, we get: $$y = 2\pi x$$ Thus, x = ln(y)/ln(2π). This is an approximate solution to the inverse function, but it will produce errors as y approaches infinity or zero, and for values of x that are very small or large.
A.350	  The next step you mentioned is definitely correct. To prove that $P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+1)$, you need to check that $\frac{(k+1)^3-(k+1)}{2}$ and $\frac{(k+1)^3-(k+1)}{3}$ are integers. This means that you need to check that: \begin{equation*} \frac{2(k+1)^2+(k+1)}{2} = (k+1) + 1 \qquad \text{and} \qquad \frac{(k+1)^3-(k+1)}{3} \in \mathbb{Z} \end{equation*} If you can prove that these two equations hold true, then you have proven that $P(k+1)$ is true.
A.352	  To find a positive continuous function with a finite area and whose limit as x approaches infinity does not exist, we can use the following example of a function f(x) = |x|-1. This function is continuous on [0,∞) and has a positive area $A$ = ∞ since the definite integral $\int_0^\infty (|x|-1) dx$ does not converge. On the other hand, the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity does not exist since f(x) = x as x approaches infinity for either x > 0 or x < 0. This means that we can find an infinite sequence of x values xn such that f(xn) = xn as xn approaches infinity.
A.353	  Yes, I can explain why two random variables, X and Y, being uncorrelated does not necessarily mean they are independent. Two random variables are independent when and only when their joint distribution can be calculated as the product of their individual distributions. In other words, if we know the distribution of one random variable, we can calculate the distribution of the other random variable without knowing anything about their correlation. Being uncorrelated, on the other hand, means that the linear relationship between the two random variables is zero. In other words, the two random variables do not change together when one of them changes. However, two random variables can still have a non-linear relationship or be influenced by each other in some other way, which means they are not independent. For example, consider two random variables, X and Y, where X represents the number of hours a student studies for an exam, and Y represents the student's exam score. Although the two random variables are likely to be uncorrelated (since their relationship is not linear), they are not independent (since knowing the number of hours a student studies is often essential for predicting their exam score). Another example could be X and Y representing height and weight, where X and Y are likely to be correlated since taller individuals tend to weigh more, but they are not independent since both height and weight are influenced by factors such as diet and exercise. A real-world example where two random variables are neither independent nor casually connected could be X and Y representing the price and volume of a stock, respectively. Although the two variables are not related in a linear manner (since changing the volume traded in a stock can affect its price), they are not independent (since both the price and volume of a stock can be influenced by external factors such as market sentiment and economic conditions).
A.354	  Sure, I'd be happy to help! To prove that $p_1p_2\mid a$ when $p_1\mid a$ and $p_2\mid a$, we can use the fact that if $\mid$ denotes divisibility, then $\mid$ and $\mid^*$ (divisibility in the opposite direction) are equivalent. This means that if $p_1\mid a$ and $p_2\mid a$, then $a\mid p_1$ and $a\mid p_2$. Therefore, we have two cases: $p_1\mid a$ and $a\mid p_1$, and $p_2\mid a$ and $a\mid p_2$. We can then apply Euclid's theorem on divisibility. For the first case, we have $p_1\mid a$ and $p_1\mid p_1$, so $p_1\mid p_1p_1$. Since $a$ is also a factor of $p_1p_1$, we have $p_1p_1\mid a$. For the second case, we have $p_2\mid a$ and $p_2\mid p_2$, so $p_2\mid p_2p_2$. Since $a$ is also a factor of $p_2p_2$, we have $p_2p_2\mid a$. Therefore, in both cases, $p_1p_2\mid a$. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
A.355	  The given equation $f(f(x)^2+f(y))=xf(x)+y$ is a functional equation, which is an equation involving a function and its values on two different arguments. To find solutions to this equation, we need to look for functions $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ that satisfy it for all $x,y\in\mathbb{R}$. One approach to solving functional equations is to try to reduce the equation to something simpler, and then work backwards to obtain the function $f$. In this case, we can make a substitution by squaring both sides of the equation: $$(f(f(x)^2+f(y)))^2=(x^2f^2(x)+y^2f^2(y))=(x^2f^2(x)+y^2f^2(x))=(x^2y+y^2)=(xy+y^2)f^2$$ Substituting $(f^2(x))$ for $f$ gives: $$(f^2(f(x)^2+f(y)))^2=(x^2f^2(x)+y^2f^2(y))=(x^2y+y^2)f^2$$ Squaring both sides, we get: $$f^4(x^2(f(x)^2+f(y))^2)=(x^2y+y^2)f^6$$ Dividing both sides by $x^4$ gives: $$f^4(f(x)^2+f(y))^2=(x^2y+y^2)f^6/x^4$$ Dividing both sides by $(x^2y+y^2)f^2$ gives: $$(f(x)^2+f(y))^2=(x^2+1)/(f^4) \implies (f(x)^2+f(y))=(sqrt(x^2+1)/f^2)xf(x)+sqrt(x^2+1)/f^2y$$ Substituting $f(x)=x$ and $f(y)=y$ gives:
A.356	  To solve the differential equation $ f^{(k)}(x)=f(x)\ $ where $ k $ is a natural number, we need to find the general solution. The general solution of the differential equation $ y'=y\ $, where $ y $ is a function of $ x $, is given by $ y(x)=Ae^x\ $, where $ A $ is a constant. For each value of $ k $ in $ k=1,2,\cdots,n $, we can apply this formula to obtain the general solution of the differential equation $ f^{(k)}(x)=f(x)$. For $ k=1 $, the general solution is $ f(x)=A_0e^x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{A_0x^n}{n!}\ $. For $ k=2 $, the general solution is $ f(x)=Ae^x-Be^{-x}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{(\frac{A_0x^{2n}}{(2n)!}+\frac{A_1x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!})}$. For $ k=3 $, the general solution is $ f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{i=0}^{2}\frac{A_ix^{3n+i}}{(3n+i)!}$. \ For general $ k $, the general solution of the differential equation $ f^{(k)}(x)=f(x)\ $ is not known. However, we can evaluate $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!}$ for any $ k $ using the formula: \begin{align} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!} &= \frac{1}{(2\pi)^k}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\frac{e^{-i(n+k)x}}{(n+k)!}\text{d}x\quad\text{where $ k\in\{1,2,\cdots,n\}$.} \end{align} This formula gives us the Fourier series representation of $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{x^{kn}}{(kn)!}$. To evaluate this expression for general $ k $, we need to compute
A.357	  This is a well-known problem in mathematics called the Diophantine Equation. Specifically, the problem is as follows: Suppose that a finite sequence of numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ is given, and we are looking for all polynomial functions $f(x)$ of degree at most $n$ such that $f(i)=a_i$ for all $i=1,2, \ldots,n$. In the case of a sequence with only two terms such as $(2, 4)$, it is easy to see that there are exactly two possible functions $f(x)=2x$ and $f(x)=4x-\frac{2}{3}$ (in fact, these are the only possible polynomial functions of degree at most $2$). However, as we increase the number of terms in the sequence, the number of possible functions grows exponentially with the length of the sequence. The solutions to this problem can be found using various methods in number theory and algebraic geometry. One common approach is to use the concept of a Galois representation to study the symmetries of the sequence and determine the possible values of $f(x)$ based on those symmetries. Another approach is to use techniques from algebraic geometry such as the modular form associated with the sequence, which can give us a way to count the number of possible solutions. In general, it is not known how many possible functions there are for a given finite sequence. The Diophantine Equation is a notoriously difficult problem with no known solution in general. However, there are many important special cases where a solution has been found. For example, it is known that there are no nonsingular polynomial functions of degree at most $10$ with $f(1)=1$ and $f(2)=2$, which are the values of the first two terms in the sequence $\pi/4$. Similarly, it is known that there are no polynomial functions of degree at most $7$ with $f(1)=2$ and $f(5)=3$, which are the values of the first two terms in the sequence $\pi/3$. Overall, the Diophantine Equation is a fascinating problem with many interesting applications in mathematics and beyond.
A.358	  The formula for the area of a surface of revolution is given by $\int 2\pi y \,ds$, where $ds = \sqrt{1 + \frac{dy}{dx}^2}$. The intuition is to think of the surface as a collection of small pieces, where each piece looks like a tiny cylinder. The formula comes from calculating the perimeter of this collection of pieces, by adding up the circumferences of the cylinders. Since each cylinder is a circle, the circumference is simply $2\pi y$, where $y$ is the height of the cylinder at that point. To understand why the formula works, it's important to consider that the surface of revolution is not flat, but instead is a curved surface. In particular, it's a surface where the height varies in a nonlinear way along the x direction. This means that no simple rectangular shape can contain the surface of revolution. Instead, we need to break it down into small pieces and add them up to get the total surface area. The shell method can be used to estimate the surface area of such a surface, by dividing it into small regions and approximating each region with a collection of tiny cylinders. The difference between this method and using cylinders to estimate the volume is that the shells are not all the same height. In particular, they are defined by the equation $y = f(x)$, where $f(x)$ is a function that gives the height of the cylinder at any point on the surface of revolution. This means that each shell can be approximated as a collection of tiny cylinders with heights that vary along the x direction. In general, the shell method is a versatile tool for approximating the area of a curved surface. It can be applied to a wide range of surfaces, including spheres, cylinders, cones, and more. However, it's important to keep in mind that the approximation can become very good or very bad, depending on the accuracy of the function used to define the height of the shells.
A.359	  Answer: Apparent inconsistencies in integration can arise in situations where the substitution involves taking the square root under the integral sign, or where the integral is not over a principal angle of the inverse trigonometric operation. Regarding the first issue, the absolute value of a square root is not always taken because most integrals involve calculating definite integrals, which are typically positive-valued quantities. Since square roots are positive numbers, their values are positive by definition. To address the issue of using square roots under an integral sign, it is important to understand that square roots can be calculated differently depending on whether they are part of a definite or indefinite integral. For definite integrals, square roots can be expressed under the integral sign using the technique of partial fractions. This involves expanding the integral into two or more terms, where each term includes a square root and a denominator as a factor. For example, the integral $\int_0^1 \left(\frac{1}{x+\sqrt{x}}\right) dx$ can be expanded as $\frac{1}{x+\sqrt{x}} - \frac{1}{x}$ and then integrated separately. For indefinite integrals, square roots are typically treated according to the rules for integration. For example, to find the antiderivative of $\int \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\right) dx$, we can use the chain rule and substitute $\sqrt{x}$ for the new variable $u$: $\int \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{x}}\right) dx = x^{\frac{1}{2}} + C$. As for the second issue, an integral that is not over a principal angle of the inverse trigonometric operation may not have a solution in terms of sines and cosines. In these cases, a different substitution or integration technique may be necessary to find a solution. Overall, as with many mathematical concepts, consistency in integration depends on understanding the specific scenarios in which it is applied.
A.360	  The Fourier transform of a function $f(x)$ is given by: $$F(k) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{-i2\pi kx}dx$$ where $i$ is the imaginary unit, $k$ is a wave number, and $F(k)$ is the Fourier transform. The function $f(x)$ should be integrable over the interval $[-\infty,\infty]$. To find the Fourier transform of $1/\vert x \vert$, we use the definition of the integral: $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{1}{\vert x \vert} dx = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} dx + \int_{-\infty}^{0} \frac{1}{-x} dx$$ We can split the integral into two parts: $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} dx + \int_{-\infty}^{0} \frac{1}{-x} dx = \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} dx - \int_{-\infty}^{0} \frac{1}{x} dx$$ Integrating both sides with respect to $x$ gives: $$\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x} dx - \int_{-\infty}^{0} \frac{1}{x} dx = \ln \vert x \vert \Big\vert_{0}^{\infty} + \ln \vert x \vert \Big\vert_{- \infty}^{0}$$ Using the value of $\ln\vert x\vert \Big\vert_{0}^{\infty} = \ln \infty = 0$ and $\ln\vert x\vert \Big\vert_{- \infty}^{0} = -\ln 0 = \infty$, we get: $$\ln 0 - \ln \infty - \ln \Big\vert x \Big\vert_{-\infty}^{\infty} = \ln 0 - \ln \infty - \infty = -\infty$$ Therefore, the Fourier transform of $1/\vert x \vert$ is: $$F(k)
A.361	  No, a Riemann-integrable function is not always differentiable. The Riemann-integral is a way of approximating the definite integral of a function by summing up values of the function at several points within the interval of interest. It does not require that the function be differentiable at all points. In fact, a function can be continuous but not differentiable, and still be Riemann-integrable due to the fact that the function has a well-defined antiderivative. This means that $F=F(x)=\int_a^xf(t)dt$ is a continuous function but not necessarily differentiable for every $x$ in $[a,b]$. The passage suggests that Riemann-integrable functions cannot be differentiable, but this is actually not the case. A function can be Riemann-integrable without being differentiable, but it cannot be differentiable without being Riemann-integrable. Therefore, a Riemann-integrable function is always differentiable, except in cases where the function is not continuous or has a jump discontinuity, since the antiderivative does not exist for these types of functions.
A.362	  Kuratowski's Theorem and the Axiom of Choice Kuratowski's Theorem states that every well-ordered set has a maximal chain, and that the maximal chain is unique. The Axiom of Choice states that given any set X of disjoint nonempty sets, there exists a choice function which maps each set in X to a nonempty subset of that set. Your question seems to be whether Kuratowski's Theorem could be proved using the Axiom of Choice instead of the well-ordering principle. While it is possible to prove Kuratowski's Theorem in this way, it is not straightforward and is not a commonly used proof technique. One way to do it is to use the Axiom of Choice to construct a chain of disjoint sets which includes all the elements of the well-ordered set, and then show that the chain is a maximal chain. This can be done by starting with the smallest element of the set and using the Axiom of Choice to construct a set of disjoint sets which includes all the elements of the set up to and including that element. Then, for each element in the well-ordered set, we use the Axiom of Choice to construct a set of disjoint sets which includes all the elements of the set up to and including that element, and concatenate this set with the previous one to obtain the next set in the chain. This process continues until the well-ordered set is exhausted. Finally, it is shown that the resulting chain is a maximal chain.
A.363	  I can help you with that. To prove the statement, we will use the fact that we can always decompose a non-negative random variable $Y$ as $Y = X + X_1$, where $X_1 \geq 0$ and $X_1 \bot X$ ($X_1$ is independent of $X$). This decomposition is called the Doob decomposition. For each $x(0 \leq x) = x_0 + x_1$, where $x_0$ is an integer and $0 \leq x_1 < X_0$, we can define $Z = [x_1 0] \wedge X$ (note that if $x_1 = 0$, then $Z = X_0$). Now, let's consider the function $f(x) = \min(x, 1)$. We can check that $f$ is a non-negative function. Moreover, for any $y, z \geq 0$, we have $f(c + d) \leq f(c) + f(d)$, which implies that $f$ is a contractant function. Using the Doob decomposition above, we can decompose $X^*$ as follows: $$X^* = X_0 + X_1 = X_0 + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} X_n[0, 1]_{n} = X_0 + \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} (X_n - Z_n) + Z_0 + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} Z_n.$$ Note that $X_0 \wedge (0,1] = X_0 - [X_0 - X_0\wedge X_0-1] = 0$, since $0 \leq X_0 - X_0\wedge X_0-1 \leq X_0 - X_0\wedge 0 = X_0$. Thus, in the first equality we can replace $X_1$ by $Z_0 \wedge X_0$. Now, we apply the contraction property of $f$ to each of the terms on the right-hand side: $$X^* + Z_0 = X_0 + (\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (X
A.364	  Inequality in metric space For a point $x$ and a non-empty subset $A$ of a metric space $(X, d)$, define $\inf\left\{ d(x,a):a\in A\right\}$. The distance between $x$ and $A$ is defined as \begin{align}\inf_{y\in A}d(x,y), \end{align} where $d(x,\cdot)$ is the metric function for $x$. Prove that if $y$ is another point in $X$ then \begin{align}\inf_{y\in A}d(x,y)\leqslant d(x,y)+d(y,A). \end{align} Let's start by bounding the distance between $x$ and $A$ using the fact that the infimum of a set is less than or equal to any element of that set. Since $\inf_{y\in A}d(x,y) \leqslant d(x,y),$ We know that $d(x,y)\leqslant d(x,y)+d(y,A)$. Therefore, $\inf_{y\in A}d(x,y) \leqslant d(x,y)+d(y,A)$. And this completes the proof.
A.365	  Yes, it is well-known in set theory that every infinite ordinal $\alpha$ is equinumerous to its set of successors $\alpha^+$. This is known as Cantor's Diagonalization, which states that for every countable set, there is a bijection with a proper subset of the set of natural numbers. In this case, when $\alpha$ is an infinite ordinal, we can extend this mapping to $\alpha^+$ by adding a new element to the domain map that corresponds to the first element in $\alpha^+ \setminus \alpha$. This will create an injection from $\alpha^+$ to $\alpha$.
A.366	  Not sure what you have written, but I can see that you have started by attempting to define a function $f:X'\to\mathbb{C}$ such that $f(e_i)=0$ for all $i$, which would make $T\{\ket{e_1},\ket{e_2},\dots ,\ket{e_n}\}=0$. However, this does not establish linearly independence of T. An element $\ket{x}\in \mathcal{T}$ is linearly independent if and only if for any non-zero scalar $\lambda$ and any scalars $c_i$, $i=1,\dots,n$ we have $\langle \ket{x}\vert c_i\ket{e_i}\rangle=0$ for all $i$. To prove that $\mathcal{T}$ is linearly independent, you need to show that $\langle \ket{T}\vert c_i\vert \ket{e}\rangle=0$ for all $i$ and $\forall c_i$. This is equivalent to showing that $\langle \ket{\bar{X}}}\vert c_j\vert \ket{e_j}\rangle=0$ for all $\bar{X}=c_i\ket{e_i}\in T$ and $\forall j$. To do this, you can use the fact that the vectors $\{\ket{e_1},\dots,\ket{e_n}\}$ span $X$ and $T\subset X$, so $\{\ket{e_1},\dots,\ket{e_n}\} \cup T\subset X$ and we have the equality $X= \{\ket{e_1},\dots,\dots,\ket{e_n}\} \cup T$ for all $i$, then you can show that $\langle \ket{T}\vert c_j\vert \vert \vert\rangle =0$ for all $\bar{X}=c_i\vert e_i\vert \in T$ and $\forall j$ by applying the orthogonality of $\{\ket{e_1},\dots,\ket{e_n}\}$ and $\{\ket{e_1},\dots,\ket{e_n}, T\}'$ to obtain $T= \{\vert e_1\} \cup \dots \cup
A.368	  Yes, you're correct. The statement is true as $x\to\infty$. To see this, we can first note that the Basel problem can be shown to be equal to $\sum_{n\geq1}\frac{1}{n^2}$ by subtracting $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n}$ from both sides of $\frac{\pi^2}{6}=\sum_{p\leq x}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)\left(p+\frac{1}{2}\right)$. Let $\sum_{n=1}^M\frac{1}{n^2}$ denote the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the first $M$ positive integers. Then, by the integral test, we have that $\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{1}{n^2}=\lim_{M\to\infty}\sum_{n=1}^M\frac{1}{n^2}$. Since $[\frac1{x^2},\frac1{(x-1)^2}]$ is a decreasing sequence of intervals, we have that $\sum_{n\leq x}\frac{1}{n^2}\geq\sum_{n=1}^M\frac{1}{n^2}$ if $M<x$. Therefore, $$\left(\sum_{n=1}^M\frac{1}{n^2}-\sum_{n\leq x}\frac{1}{n^2}\right)\leq x\left(\frac{1}{x^2}-\frac{1}{(x-1)^2}\right)=-\left(1-\frac{1}{x}\right)$$ as $x\to\infty$. Setting $\sum_{n\leq x}\frac{1}{n^2}=\sum_{n\leq x}\frac{1}{n^2}+\mathcal O(1/x)$ yields: $$\left(\sum_{n=1}^M\frac{1}{n^2}-\sum_{n=1}^x\frac{1}{n^2}\right)\geq\left(\sum_{n=1}^M\frac{1}{n^2}-\sum_{n\leq x}\frac{1}{n^2}\right)+\
A.369	  Here are some steps to help you find a recurrent relationship for the integral: 1. First, notice that you can factor the denominator of the integrand as $(1+2^n) \sin{x} = (2^n+1) \sin{x}$. This is because we can use the identity $\sin{x} = \cos{(n\pi/2 - x)}$. 2. Now, we can substitute in an expression for $\sin{x}$ using the trigonometric addition identity $\sin{x + y} = \sin{x} \cos{y} - \cos{x} \sin{y}$. We get: $$(2^n+1) \sin{x} = (2^n+1) (\sin{x} \cos{x/\sqrt{2}} - \cos{x} \sin{x/\sqrt{2}})$$ 3. By distributing the $(2^n+1)$ terms and writing out the resulting terms with their factors, we get: $$(2^n+1) \sin{x} = 2^n \sin{x} \cos{x/\sqrt{2}} + \sin{x} \cos{(n\pi/2 - x)/\sqrt{2}} - \sin{x/\sqrt{2}} \cos{(n\pi/2 - x)}.$$ 4. Now we can substitute back in the equation for $J_n$ and simplify. We get: $$J_n = \int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{\sin{(nx)} }{(2^n+1) \sin{x}} \,\mathrm{d}x.$$ $$ = \int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{\sin{(nx)} }{(2^n+1) \sin{(n\pi/2 - x) / \sqrt{2}}} \,\mathrm{d}x.$$ $$ = \int_{-\pi}^\pi \frac{\sin{(nx)} }{(2^n+1) \sin{(n\pi/2 - x) / \sqrt{2}}} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \sin{(n\pi
A.370	  The supremum of functions over the set of step functions, where the step functions are formed by partitioning a measurable set into a finite number of intervals, is equal to the supremum of functions over the set of simple functions. This means that the Lebesgue integral with respect to measure $\mu$ of any positive function $f\in L^1(\mu)$ is well-defined and can be computed using the definition of the Lebesgue integral of simple functions as follows: $$\int fd\mu = \sup\{\int s d\mu \ :\ s \in S(\mu)$$ where $S(\mu)$ is the Riemann-Stieltjes sums with respect to $\mu$ and $f$. Therefore, if we instead of taking simple functions in the supremum, we would take step functions, i.e. $s(x)=\sum\limits_{j=1}^nc_i\chi_{I_j}(x)$ where $I_j$ are intervals (any type, like $(a,b), (a,b]$, $[a,b), [a,b]$) then the supremum of functions over the set of step functions would be equal to the supremum of functions over the set of simple functions, and the Lebesgue integral with respect to measure $\mu$ of any positive function $f\in L^1(\mu)$ can be computed using the same formula.
A.371	  Yes, you can say $|f(x) g(x)|=||fg||$. The norm of a function $f$ is defined as $\|f\|=\sup\{|f(x)|,x\in[0,1]\}$. This means that for a given $x$, $|f(x)|$ can take on any value between $0$ and $\infty$. Therefore, if we take $x\in[0,1]$, then we can write $||fg||=||f||\ space||g||= (\max\{|f(x)| \ })\space(\max\{ |g(x)|\})$ (where the maximum is taken over all $x$ in $[0,1]$). Since $|f(x)|\leq(\max\{|f(x)|\})$ and $|g(x)|\leq(\max\{ |g(x)|\})$, we have that $|f(x)g(x)|\leq (\max\{|f(x)|\})\space(\max\{ |g(x)|\} )=||fg||$. This implies that $|f(x)g(x)|=||fg||$ and $||fg||\le||f||\space||g||$ as stated in the problem.
A.372	  The ring of integers is defined the way it is because it is a natural generalization of the integers to allow for the study of Diophantine equations of higher degree and more general elliptic curves. In particular, the inclusion of the roots of unity $\sqrt{-1}$ means that we can also study quadratic equations with a negative leading coefficient, such as $x^2 + 1 = 0$. At the same time, the ring of integers also provides a framework for study of elliptic curves of higher genus, and can be used to give information about rational points on such curves. Overall, the ring of integers allows us to study a wider range of Diophantine problems than just those solvable by the Gaussian integers or Pell's equation.
A.373	  The method of infinite descent assumes the irrationality of $\sqrt n$ when $n$ is not a perfect square. It begins by assuming that $n=m^2$ where $m$ is an integer and $n$ is not a perfect square. Since $n$ is not a perfect square, there will always be an integer $k$ such that $k^2<n$. We then set $c=\sqrt{km}$ and note that $c>0$ and $c^2<n$. This contradicts our assumption that $n=m^2$, since $c^2<n$ implies that $m^2<c^2$, which cannot be the case. Therefore, our initial assumption that $n=m^2$ must be false, which means that $\sqrt n$ is irrational. As for the second problem, it points out that the method of infinite descent assumes the irrationality of $\sqrt n$ when $n$ is not a perfect square. However, the method only fails to work in the case where $n$ is a perfect square because our initial assumption of $n=m^2$ assumes that $n$ is a perfect square. In other words, the method works perfectly fine when $n$ is not a perfect square because it shows that $\sqrt n$ is irrational when $n$ is not a perfect square, as I described in the previous paragraph. This is why the method of infinite descent is only applicable to the case where $n$ is not a perfect square.
A.375	  Sure, I'll help you with that problem. When $n$ is even, the equation becomes: $$x^2 + 7 = 2^{2r+2} = 4^{r+1}$$ We can then solve for $x$ as: $$x^2 = 4^{r+1} - 7$$ $$x = \pm\sqrt{4^{r+1} - 7}$$ \begin{itemize} \item For positive values of $x$, $x$ must be a square root of an even number, so it must be $2k$ for some $k$. Then $x^2$ is a multiple of $16$ and so the only possible solutions are: \begin{itemize} \item $x = 2^2 = 4$ for $r=0$ and $x = 2^5 = 32$ for $r=1$ (since $2^6 = 3$ and $2^7 = 4$ are also solutions). \end{itemize} \item For negative values of $x$, $\sqrt{4^{r+1} - 7}$ is not an integer. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case. \end{itemize} Now let's consider the case where $n$ is odd. We have: $$x^2 + 7 = 2^n$$ $$x^2 = 2^n - 7$$ We can try some small values of $n$ to see if there's a solution: \begin{itemize} \item $n=1$: $2^{-1}-7=15$, so $x^2=15$ and $x=\sqrt{15}\approx 3.861+3^{-1/2}\approx 7.748$. This is not an integer, so there are no solutions for even values of $x$. \item $n=3$: $2^{3}-7=7$, so $x^2=7$ and $x=\sqrt{7}\approx 2.666$. This is not an integer, so there
A.376	  To evaluate the limit of this problem, we can use the fact that $0 \leq \frac{\sqrt1+\sqrt2+\sqrt3+\ldots+\sqrt n}{n\sqrt n} \leq 1$. This is because the terms add up to a maximum of $\dfrac{n+1}{\sqrt n}$ and each term is less than or equal to $\sqrt n$. Because the limit of $\dfrac{n+1}{\sqrt n}$ as $n \to \infty$ is $\infty$, we can use the fact that $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ (Riemann sum of $0$ at $i=1$, $\frac{1}{n}$ at $i=2$, $i+1$ at $i=3+j$, $i+1$ at $i=4+j$ for $j=1$ to $n-1$) is equal to $\frac{1}{2}$. We can then use the fact that $\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(n+1)=\dfrac{n+1}{2}$ and substitute this in for $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ to get: $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ $\frac{\sqrt1+\sqrt2+\sqrt3+\ldots+\sqrt n}{n\sqrt n} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)(n+1)} = \frac{1}{\dfrac{n+1}{2}} = \frac{2n+1}{n+1} = \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ $\frac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{2n+1}$ Since $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ $\frac{1}{2\sqrt n} = 0$ and $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ $\frac{1+1+2+\ldots+n-1}{n^2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$, we can substitute these results in for $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ $\frac{1}{2n+1}$ and $\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}$ $\frac{n+1}{2}$ respectively to get: $\lim\
A.378	  The exponent rule states that $\left(ab\right)^\frac{1}{n}=\sqrt[n]{ab}$ for any real positive number $n$. Therefore, $\left(-3\right)^\frac{2}{2}=\sqrt[2]{(-3)^2}=\sqrt{9}=3$.
A.379	  Properties of a set of all isomorphisms $ f: G \to G $ Let $G$ be a group and $ S $ the set of all isomorphisms $ f: G \to G$. We first want to show that $(S, \circ)$ is also a group. i) Assume that $ x \in G$ and $ f_1, f_2 \in S$. Then $f_2(x) = y \in G$, since $ f_1 $ is an isomorphism. $ f_2(y) = z \in G $ since $ f_2 $ is an isomorphism. Then $ f_1(f_2(x)) = f_1(y) = z \in G $; hence $f_1, f_2 \in S \longrightarrow f_1 \circ f_2 \in S$. Thus $(f_1, f_2) \in S^2$. Since $ S^2$ is finite and $ S$ is abelian, $(S, \circ)$ is commutative. Hence $(S, \circ)$ is a group. ii) We have $ id_G \in G$ and $ id_S = e \in S$, where $ e $ is the identity transformation on $ G$. Since $ S^2$ is finite, $(id_S, id_S) = (e,e) \in S \times S$, so $ id_S \in S$. This means that $ id_G$ is an isomorphism, which is equivalent to $ id_G$ being the identity automorphism of $ G$. Since $ id_G \in S$, we have that $(S, \circ)$ is a group. iii) Since $ S$ is closed under taking inverses, $ f^{-1} \in S$ if $ f \in S$. Hence $f^{-1} \in S \longrightarrow f^{-1} \in S^2$. Since $ S^2$ is finite, $ f^{-1} \in S$. If $| S | = 1$, then $ S$ has only one element, which is the identity automorphism of $ G$, and every element of $ G$ has an order of 1 or 2. Since $ f \in
A.380	  $f(x) = 0$ is the unique solution to $f'(x) \sin(x) + f'(x) \cos(x) = 0$ for all $x \in [0,\pi]$. To begin with, let's consider what happens if $f(x) > 0$ for even $x \in [0,\pi]$. Since $\sin(x)$ and $\cos(x)$ are both bounded on $[0,\pi]$ and we can assume that $f'(x) > 0$ for even $x \in [0,\pi]$ (this follows from the continuity of $f$), we can conclude that $\sin(x) > f'(x)/\cos(x)$ for even $x \in [0,\pi]$. Therefore, $f'(x)/\sin(x) < 1$, which leads to $\int_0^\pi f'(x) \sin(x) dx < \infty$. If we can show that the integral has a nontrivial value, then we can prove that $\int_0^\pi f'(x) \sin(x) dx = 0$ contradicts the fact that $f(x)\neq 0$ for even $x \in [0,\pi]$. To show that the integral has a nontrivial value, let us consider the function $f(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} = \frac{\tan(x)}{\sqrt{\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x)}}$. Since $\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} = f(x)$ is differentiable on $[0,\pi]$ and $f'(x) = f''(x)/(\cos^2(x) + \sin^2(x))$ is continuous on $[0,\pi]$, we have $\int_{0}^\pi f'(x) \sin(x)dx = \int_{0}^\pi f''(x) \sin(x)dx$ which is an indefinite integral. Since $f(x) = \tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)} = \frac{1}{2-\cos(x)}$ is not constant on
A.381	  One way to show that $A_1 \times ... \times A_n$ is countable is to show that there exists a function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A_1 \times ... \times A_n$ that is onto and has a countable domain. We start with the bijections $fi: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A_i$ for $i = 1, ..., n$. We can concatenate these bijections to obtain a function $F: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A_1 \times ... \times A_n$. Specifically, we define $F(n) = (fi(n), fi(n), ..., fi(n))$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$. Note that $F$ is onto since for any $(a_1, ..., a_n) \in A_1 \times ... \times A_n$, there is a unique $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that $F(n) = (a_1, ..., a_n)$. To show that $F$ has a countable domain, we need to find a way to count the values of $\mathbb{N}$. One way to do this is to count the pairs $(i, j) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ such that $i \leq j$. This is because if $(i, j) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ has $i < j$, then $(i, j) \in \mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}$ implies $F(i+j) = (fi(i+1), fi(i+2), ..., fi(i)) = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_k) \in A_1 \times ... \times A_n$. Therefore, $F$ has a countable domain and is bijective. Hence, $A := A_1 \times ... \times A_n$ is countable.
A.382	  Let $SS=\{ A_1,A_2,A_3,\ldots\}$, and let $V = \{ v \mid v : SS \to \{ \mathbf{T}, \mathbf{F} \} \}$ .Is the set $V$ countable? A: True
A.383	  Answer: To prove that $f_a(z):=\frac{z-a}{1-\overline{a}z}$ maps the unit disk into itself when $|a|<1$, we will show that $f_a(z)$ is injective on the unit disk. Assume that $f_a(z)=f_a(w)$ for some $|z|<1$ and $|w|<1$. Then we have: \begin{align*} \frac{z-a}{1-\overline{a}z}-\frac{w-a}{1-\overline{a}w}&=\frac{f_a(z)-f_a(w)}{1-\overline{a}z-\overline{a}w}\\ &=\frac{(z-a)(\overline{w}-a)-(z-w)(\overline{a}-w)}{(1-\overline{a}z)(1-\overline{a}w)}\\ &=(z-a)(\overline{w}-a)-(z-w)(\overline{a}-w)\\ &=(z-a)(w-a)-(z-w)(a-w)\\ &=(zw-za-zw-wa)+(z(a-w)-wa-z(a-w))\\ &=(za-zw+wa-za-wz)>0 \end{align*} where the last inequality follows from the triangle inequality. Therefore, $f_a(z)$ is injective on the unit disk, so it maps it onto itself. This finishes the proof. Note that this proof does not rely on the maximum principle or any other advanced machinery, only basic facts about complex numbers such as the fact that $\overline{a}-w$ is real and the triangle inequality.
A.384	  The notation in this equation indicates that $f_3(n)$ is defined as the number of ways to choose 2 elements from a set of $n$ elements without replacement, which is equivalent to computing the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{2}$. In general, the binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ represents the number of ways to choose $k$ items from a set of $n$ items without replacement, and it is defined as follows: $$\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{(k!(n-k)!)}$$ where $!$ denotes the factorial function, which means the product of all positive integers up to that number. So in this equation, $\binom{n}{2}$ represents the number of ways to choose 2 items from a set of $n$ items without replacement, and $f_3(n)$ represents the function that maps a positive integer $n$ to this number of binomial coefficients.
A.385	  Properties of size function in a general Euclidean domain In ring theory, a given ring $R$ is called a Euclidean domain if there exists a function $\sigma:R -\{0\}\rightarrow \{0,1,2,3...\}$ which satisfies the division algorithm i.e. if $a,b \in R$, then there exists $q,r \in R$ such that $b = aq + r$ and either $r = 0$ or $\sigma(r) < \sigma(a)$. The function $\sigma$ is called the size function of the ring. In ring theory, the general Euclidean domain $R$ is defined to be a non-zero ring equipped with a function $\sigma:R \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ such that each $a \in R - \{0\}$ has a finite size $\sigma(a)$. The concept of a size function is central to the study of Euclidean domains. We often use a size function to define a topology on a ring by declaring that a subset $U$ of $R$ is open if and only if for all $a \in U$, there exists a $b \in R$ such that $b > a$ and $\sigma(b) > \sigma(a)$. This allows us to study the properties of the ring and its elements using tools from topology. Now, we can ask whether there are any general results about the size function that hold for all Euclidean domains. One such result is that the size function $\sigma$ is injective on the entire non-zero ring $R$. This means that if $a,b \in R - \{0\}$ and $\sigma(a) = \sigma(b)$, then $a = b$. In other words, the size function assigns a unique size to each element in the ring. Additionally, we can define the height of an element $a \in R$ as the distance from $a$ to the center of the ring modulo its size. That is, if $c$ is the center of the ring and $H$ is the multiplicative group generated by $c$, then the height of $a$ is defined as $h(a) = - log_H \sigma(a)$ + $\lceil log_R |
A.387	  It looks like you solved this question correctly. Well done!
A.388	  Sure, I can help you with that. To solve the system, we first need to find its augmented matrix: $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&10&-6&1\\1&&2\\2&&5\end{array}\right]$$ Then, we can use elementary row operations to put the matrix in row echelon form. After performing the following row operations on the first two rows of the augmented matrix, we get: $$\left[\begin{array}{ccc|c}1&10&-6&1\\0&&-22\\2&&5\end{array}\right]$$ Since there are no more leadings zeros in the matrix, it is already in row echelon form. To find the value of $k$, we can use substitution or elimination method. In this case, we will use elimination. We can use the first equation to eliminate $k$ from the second and third equations: $$\begin{cases} 1X_1+kX_2 - X_3 = 2 \\ 2X_1 -X_2 + kX_3 = 5 \\ X_1 +10X_2 -6X_3 + kX_3 =1 \end{cases} $$ where $X_1, X_2, X_3$ are the variables. First, we can subtract the second equation from the first: $$1X_1+kX_2 - X_3 = 2 $$ $$-X_3 = -2 $$ $$X_3 = 2 $$ Substituting this value of $X_3$ into the third equation: $$X_1 +10X_2 -6(2) = 1 $$ $$X_1 +10X_2 -12 = 1 $$ $$X_1 +10X_2 = 13 $$ Substituting this equation into the first equation: $$1X_1+kX_2 - (2) = 2 $$ $$1X_1+kX_2 = 14 $$ $$k = 14 $$ Substituting $k=14$ into the second equation: $$2X_1 -X_2 + 14X_3
A.389	  The series is known as the harmonic series: $$\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{i}=\frac{H}{N}$$ where H is the harmonic constant. To determine if the series with r different from 1 will converge, we can apply the integral test. We can create a function F(x) such that $$0<F_0(x)=F_1(x)=F_2(x)...F_N(x)<1$$ For all x in the interval of consideration. We then integrate F(x) from 0 to N and compare it to the area under the curve of the harmonic series from 0 to N. If $$\int_0^N F(x)dx\le \frac{H}{N}$$ then the series will converge. Applying this test, we get $$0<F(x)=F(x)=F(x)=F_N(x)=\frac{1+r}{2i}+\frac{1+r}{2i}\frac{1}{(1+r)^i}$$ for $i=1$ to $N$. We can see that this function decreases as i increases, so we will have $$\int_1^N F(x)dx>\int_1^N F_1(x)dx\ge\int_1^{N-1} F_2(x)dx>\int_1^{N-2} F_3(x)dx\ge\int_1^{N-3} F_4(x)dx>...>\int_2^N F_N(x)dx>\frac{1}{2}\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{(1+r)^i}$$ Therefore, since the sum of the function is always greater than the sum of the harmonic series, the series will converge when N is large. The general formula for the sum of this series is $$\sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{(1+r)^i}=\frac{(1+r)^{N+1}-(1+r)-rN}{r^2(1+r)^N}$$
A.391	  The $C_r$ inequality is a powerful result in probability theory. It states that for any $r>0$, $$ \mathbb{E} \left|X+Y\right|^r \le c_r \left( \mathbb{E} \left|X\right|^r + \mathbb{E} \left|Y\right|^r\right) $$ for some constant $c_r$. This inequality is also known as the "triangle inequality" due to the geometric interpretation. One possible proof of the $C_r$ inequality for $r>1$ uses H\"older's inequality. Specifically, we have $$ \mathbb{E} \left|X+Y\right|^r \le \mathbb{E} \left|\left|X+Y\right|\right|^r \le \mathbb{E} \left| \left|X+Y\right|\right|_{p_r} \cdot \mathbb{E} \left|\left|X+Y\right|\right|^{q_r}$$ for any $p_r,q_r>1$ such that $1/p_r + 1/q_r = 1/r$. This inequality follows from the definition of the $p$-norms and the fact that $$\left|\left|X+Y\right|\right|_{p_r} = \sup_{\left|x\right|\le 1} \left|x\cdot \left|X+Y\right|\right|^{p_r} \le \left(\left\|X\right\|_{p_r} + \left\|Y\right\|_{p_r}\right)^{(p_r-1)/p_r}$$ where the supremum is taken over all values of $|x| \le 1$. Then we have \begin{align*}\mathbb{E} \left|X+Y\right|^r &\le \mathbb{E} \left| \left|X+Y\right|\right|_{p_r} \cdot \mathbb{E} \left|\left|X+Y\right|\right|^{q_r} \\ & \le \left(\left\|X\right\|_{p_r} + \left\|Y\right\|_{p_r}\right)^{(p_r-1
A.394	  Based on the passage you have provided, the $\delta$ definition of continuity requires finding the $\delta$ such that: $|f(x) - f(a)| < \epsilon$ whenever $|x-a| < \delta.$ For the case where $x$ is irrational, you can choose $\delta = \epsilon$ as $|x-a| = 1$ (since the irrational number is not equal to any rational number), and $|f(x) - f(a)| = f(x) = 0.$ For the case where $x$ is rational, you need to find the $\delta$ such that $\delta < \frac{m-n'a}{m+n}.$ Here, $m$ and $n$ are the coefficients of the given rational number $x = \frac{m}{n}$, and $m'$ is the smallest rational number such that $0 < m' - a < \frac{1}{|a|}$. Then, $f(x) = \frac{1}{n} \neq \frac{1}{n'}$, so $|f(x) - f(a)| = \frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n'} = \frac{n - n'}{n' n}$. Substituting the value of $[m']=\frac{1}{|a|}-|a|<0$, the inequality becomes $|\frac{1}{n} - \frac{1}{n'}| = \frac{1}{n'} - \frac{1}{n}|a| > \frac{1}{n}|a|$. Since, $\frac{1}{n}|a|<\frac{1}{|a|}-|a|$ and substituting $\delta = \frac{1}{m} = \frac{1}{m'},$ we get $|f(x) - f(a)| = \frac{m-n' m'}{n'm} = \frac{1}{n'}|a| > \frac{1}{n}|a|$ for all $\epsilon > 0$, thus giving the second continuity condition.
A.399	  In other words, the set $A$ has a bijection with the $\mathbb{N}$ by some function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A$. That is, $$A = \{f(1), f(2), \dots, f(n) \}$$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and every $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A$ such that $f(1) = f(2) = \dots = f(n) \neq f(n+1)$. To prove that $A$ is countable, we need to find a map $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A$ that is onto. Since the intersection of any two rectangles in $A$ is empty, we can define $f$ as follows: Let $r_{11} = r_1(1)$, $r_{21} = r_2(1)$, ..., $r_{nn} = r_n(n)$. Then, we define $f(j) = r_{j1} ^\rightarrow \cup r_{j2} ^\rightarrow \cup \dots \cup r_{jn} ^\rightarrow$, where $a^\rightarrow$ denotes the vertical projection of a rectangle onto the vertical line $x = a$. This map $f : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow A$ is onto since for any rectangle $r \in A$, $r$ and $f(1)$ have exactly one point in common on the vertical line $x = r_{1}(1)$. This is because $r_1(1)$ is the bottom-left corner of $r$, so $r_{11} \sqrt{\frac{r_{21}^2 - r_{11}^2}{r_{22} - r_{11}}}$ cannot be a point in $f(1)$ because it is vertical projection of the rectangle onto the vertical line $x = r_{1}(1)$. Therefore, the set $A$ is countable by the bijection with $\mathbb{N}$.
A.400	  Sure, I'd be happy to help you with the problem. To solve the problem, we are given that 16 players play in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon. The winner of the quarter-finals play again in the semi-finals to decide who enters the finals. Therefore, we have to consider two cases: Case 1: Both of the players we want to see play each other make it to the quarter-finals. In this case, we have $\frac{1}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{15}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{14}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{13}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{12}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{11}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{10}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{9}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{8}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{7}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{6}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{5}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{4}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{3}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{2}{16\cdot 15} + \frac{1}{16\cdot 15} = \binom{16}{2}$. Case 2: One of the players makes it to the quarter-finals, but the other player does not. In this case, we have $\frac{1}{16} + \frac{15}{16} + \frac{14}{16} + \frac{13}{16} + \frac{12}{16} + \frac{11}{16} + \frac{10}{16} + \frac{9}{16} + \frac{8}{16} + \frac{7}{16} + \frac{6}{16} + \frac{5}{16} + \frac{4}{16}
